0	10	Leofwine_draca	A new TV classic	just finished up squid game, the korean tv show that's become a global smash hit on netflix. it's truly brilliant and even better than the similar japanese show alice in borderland! the show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. shades of saw and the hunger games here, but this is rivalled only by battle royale in terms of sheer quality. as usual for korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything i've seen before. definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.	finished squid game, korean tv show that's become global smash hit netflix. truly brilliant even better similar japanese show alice borderland! show centred around contestants competing children's games cash prize, twist get killed lose. shades saw hunger games here, rivalled battle royale terms sheer quality. usual korea, writing, acting, direction superb games hugely suspenseful, unlike anything i've seen before. definitely horrifying enough premise terms violent bloodshed count horror too.	finished squid game  korean tv show that s become global smash hit netflix  truly brilliant even better similar japanese show alice borderland  show centred around contestants competing children s games cash prize  twist get killed lose  shades saw hunger games here  rivalled battle royale terms sheer quality  usual korea  writing  acting  direction superb games hugely suspenseful  unlike anything i ve seen before  definitely horrifying enough premise terms violent bloodshed count horror too 	['finish', 'squid', 'game', 'korean', 'tv', 'show', 'becom', 'global', 'smash', 'hit', 'netflix', 'truli', 'brilliant', 'even', 'better', 'similar', 'japanes', 'show', 'alic', 'borderland', 'show', 'centr', 'around', 'contest', 'compet', 'children', 'game', 'cash', 'prize', 'twist', 'get', 'kill', 'lose', 'shade', 'saw', 'hunger', 'game', 'rival', 'battl', 'royal', 'term', 'sheer', 'qualiti', 'usual', 'korea', 'write', 'act', 'direct', 'superb', 'game', 'huge', 'suspens', 'unlik', 'anyth', 'seen', 'definit', 'horrifi', 'enough', 'premis', 'term', 'violent', 'bloodsh', 'count', 'horror']
1	9	kosmasp	Just a game	well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. but with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.if like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. it may not end exactly how i would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing i reckon.as a fan of korean cinema i was curious about this anyway. and it did not dissapoint - at all. the acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. with enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!	well multiple games actually, even may find ... accurate. may look way games played here. buzz right now, probably heard quite bit already.if like got without spoilers (congrats way), show able surprise quite times. players also even story evolves. may end exactly would imagine ... also seen good thing reckon.as fan korean cinema curious anyway. dissapoint - all. acting amazing, effects great ... story mature get. enough social commentary critique make great watch!	well multiple games actually  even may find     accurate  may look way games played here  buzz right now  probably heard quite bit already if like got without spoilers  congrats way   show able surprise quite times  players also even story evolves  may end exactly would imagine     also seen good thing reckon as fan korean cinema curious anyway  dissapoint   all  acting amazing  effects great     story mature get  enough social commentary critique make great watch 	['well', 'multipl', 'game', 'actual', 'even', 'may', 'find', 'accur', 'may', 'look', 'way', 'game', 'play', 'buzz', 'right', 'probabl', 'heard', 'quit', 'bit', 'alreadi', 'like', 'got', 'without', 'spoiler', 'congrat', 'way', 'show', 'abl', 'surpris', 'quit', 'time', 'player', 'also', 'even', 'stori', 'evolv', 'may', 'end', 'exactli', 'would', 'imagin', 'also', 'seen', 'good', 'thing', 'reckon', 'fan', 'korean', 'cinema', 'curiou', 'anyway', 'dissapoint', 'act', 'amaz', 'effect', 'great', 'stori', 'matur', 'get', 'enough', 'social', 'commentari', 'critiqu', 'make', 'great', 'watch']
2	10	Tweekums	Games to die for	this runaway hit from south korea is centred on seong gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. he accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. when he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. as they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! over the course of the series gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. as the games continue more and more people are eliminated. while this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.when i saw this recommended on netflix i thought i'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as i assumed to would be a korean 'alice in borderland'. after hearing talk of its popularity i thought perhaps i should watch it sooner. i'm glad that i did. i really liked 'alice in borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. there is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. the games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. the characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. the programme's design is impressive; i especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. the cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. overall i'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.these comments are based on watching the series in korean with english subtitles.	runaway hit south korea centred seong gi-hun, heavily indebted man invited take part series six games wins solve problems. accepts gets vehicle gas puts sleep. wakes large facility four hundred people; watched masked armed guards. told rules, one states majority players want quit game end get prize money. play first game, school yard game 'red light green light' quickly learn eliminated quite literal losers shot spot!

3	5	FeastMode	if you think this is good, PLEASE watch the korean movie Oldboy	i went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. and yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. and i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. but most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). it's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. i was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. by the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. there's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. see below.things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. this is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. it was awful. can't they hire any experienced american actor? or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. but a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were so many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.	went show knowing absolutely nothing korean series. yet found annoyingly predictable almost nothing surprising me. maybe i've seen many movies, i've seen before. think lot ppl like show norm korean cinema. casuals never watched korean movie (if so, missing out, thing comes close hollywood-level quality)i mentioned title, loved series shocked low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not american remake). superior every way imaginable amazing movieoverall, okay show. really first, seemed decline halfway point. end, feeling minimal impact big moments, last episode wanted finish. there's lot good here, many negatives well. see below.things bothered (without spoilers)-a scene could really cool full-on strobe lighted see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, point angering me-characters asking moronic questions outraged things can't possibly still outraged aboutthe games start creative skill, talent strategy involved, become random filled luck-the laughable acting dialogue english scenes. norm asian cinema, mean always forgiven. awful. can't hire experienced american actor?

10	9	alindsay-al	A Fantastic truly unique show	so squid game has taken over the world these last few weeks and i thought that i had to watch it and i have now finished it and here is my review for it. the premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.main characterlee jung-jae plays the lead character gi-han on the show and he is fantastic. at first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. as he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.supporting charactersthere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. oh yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and lee jung-jae is superb and i really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. there are so many other amazing characters that i think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.storythe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. the different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. the only issue i had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and i think it could have been handled better. also there are these english speaking vip's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.scriptthe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in korean with subtitles. for the love of everything holy don't watch it with english dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. there is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.stylethe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. it is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. the pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and

14	8	qui_j	Korean Soap Opera meets Hunger Games	"this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera, chinese operatic acting and japanese theater. it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.it uses ""hunger games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. it is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the vips. they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! enjoyable for what it's meant to be!"

menow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.a brand new netflix korean thriller. this is kinda like korean version of alice in borderland. however, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. the first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. they made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. because of this, whenever the game started, i became excited and more thrilled.however, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. honestly i didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. however, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. then, near the end there's these english-speaking vips that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. i'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. there's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.overall, despite the straightforward characters, i still had an amazing time with this show. pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**this part is spoiler so stop of don't want spoiler**well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. when it was revealed, i and the main guy realized how screwed he was. then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. gotta equip those tools. finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as i wanted. it was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. but yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.	fly moonlet play among starslet see spring like ona jupiter marsin words, hold handin words, baby, kiss menow imagine listen calming

49	8	TheVictoriousV	A masterclass with only a few hiccups	"i tend to argue that when south korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%. this intensity and occasional brutality (these works hold back neither in terms of raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like secret sunshine and oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.but we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to south korean media than bouncy bts videos, more so than when parasite arrived and gave the korean wave a considerable push. for all their problems, we can thank netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.i was incredibly excited to watch squid game, even though i at first deemed it ""suspiciously popular"". what was it? one of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be ""hip"", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (or maybe those who only watched it because korean media is the current ""cool"" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense).ultimately, squid game (original title ojing-eo geim) proved to mostly be the former. that is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it ""in spite of some plot holes"").at a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of the hunger games and saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than the platform). a varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won. however, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.this becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. it's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. i won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9. subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.the characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. we go from loathing the down-on-his-luck seong gi-hun (lee jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold sae-byeok (jung ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden ""player 1"" (o yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. there are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.there is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. i was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize i might not be joking. squid game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. that being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of tv/streaming i've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). it's not as unpredictable as game of thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. this isn't the same as plot armor.my only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a hunger games sequel, complete with cartoonish rich people™ from across the world, including ones who speak american english (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not english). and yes, i will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing.still, squid game is quite the piece of work and i could praise it for far longer than i already have. its success sets a good precedent. like parasite (another far-reaching showcase of south korean vigor), squid game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's ""cool"" or not. still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message.i'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on tiktok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse. (my generation isn't much smarter than zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in project x.) we might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what i'm truly spaeing is for elon musk or whatever to take a look at this and go ""squid game, huh? that sounds pretty neat!"""

54	4	peeedeee-94281	Squid Pro Quo	there's a lot of hype surrounding this series. i thought it was okay, i almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. the problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.after fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, i stuck with the show.so the show is visually interesting. i guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? what kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)there were quite a few irritating characters. very stereotypical gangster type. you'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.and he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.the pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. the old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. but i'll get back to that later.over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. there are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. you also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? and in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?the series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. then it just loses steam and gets dumb. the introduction of the vips completely takes you out of the story. it's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.the final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. why are they given knives?! i thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the vips to bet on.the final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. and it doesn't even play out all that well.after a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. you find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. what's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. and when we hear him getting shot, how did he not get shot? the workers wouldn't know who he was.they never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. i guess they stay on the island all year? or they all go back to their regular jobs.see, so many questions, so many holes. the final ending is also pretty bad. not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.	there's lot hype surrounding series. thought okay, almost finish walking stopping halfway episode 1. problem gets overly melodramatic family issues, protagonist unlikable.after fast forwarding subway station scene meets guy eventually gets game, stuck show.so show visually interesting. guess people get intrigued see photos sets.unfortunately games created equally, based 'kids games' led believe (what kid game involves crossing glass bridge?

55	8	nidhunmoviebuff	An ingenious, immensely bingeable thriller series!	korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on netflix called squid game.taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. they then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.hwang dong-hyuk, the genius director behind silenced (2011) and the fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a north korean refugee turned pick-pocket.despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.lee jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while o yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.park hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. jung ho-yeon buys you into the north korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the south.with the storyline pointing clearly towards a season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as money heist seems to be drawing to a close.highly recommended. the perfect weekend binge!	korean content continues set

63	7	FKDZ	Decent Korean Adventure Drama, emphasis on drama.	i guess i got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so i went for it. i finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show i guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.individually it has some great episodes. but the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. this being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. it's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. it seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. i wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.the directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. this show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. this also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking i think is the first game. besides that, the other games aren't that great. mainly due to the poor cgi.now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. but you can notice when it gets sloppy. the main offenders are the cgi used for people when they fall. it looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. it's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.the acting was great for the korean actors. the vips are another story, now i wouldn't say their acting was bad. but the dialog that was written was horrible. it felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.the finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, i liked that. but then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something i don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. it's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that.

""squid game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like lee chang-dong's ""burning"" (2018) or the oscar-winning ""parasite"". but the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if bong joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""the vengeancers""."

71	8	azanti0029	Battle Royale meets The Hunger Games	an outstanding piece of korean television drama. if you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. as others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.this literally is as i have described above. a motley group of koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. what do they all have in common? poverty or huge debts or both. the eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.while we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (one man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)there are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.i don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. definitely worth your time.	outstanding piece korean television drama. see subtitles dubbed version, so. others said dubbed version atrocious.this literally described above. motley group koreans given chance compete huge cash prize fierce competition soon find lose means death.nearly 500 competitors plucked walks society take part. common? poverty huge debts both. eclectic bunch men women complete times times small teams string games soon sees number dwindle dozen.while focus key characters, whose lives collided outside game, there's various subplots including one improbable narrative organ trafficking. show strongest, simply focuses games moral dilemmas characters face.

72	8	Spartan_1_1_7	An Enthralling Entertaining Experience.	"squid game is a south korean series on netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, all i knew was that it was about some ""game"" and thought it might be like those japanese game shows or maybe kinda like wipeout but with a story. that didn't exactly turn out to be the case and i was hooked quickly during the first episode. the series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. they are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you're going through this ordeal alongside them. the psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.i loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. with good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (i'm looking at you episode 6). the games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.it also doesn't hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you'd expect from a ""game"" series. apart from a few shoddy cgi shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.however, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let's just say some things get revealed and they are what you'd boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. on top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren't good. would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. good thing it doesn't ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.overall, props to hwang dong-hyuk, the writer and director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it's heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so never give up i guess. unless you're squeamish and can't handle rough stuff, i'd highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. had a great time with it. wherever they decide to take the story next, i'll certainly am looking forward to it. and if i were to rate it, i'd give it an 8.5/10."

88	8	matrixdukenukem	Bring on the darkness	i didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on netflix looked like cheap money hiest rip off. the trailer had me little intriqued but i've had my fair share of battle royale. then i watched it and i am so glad i did.this isn't just a rip off of battle royale, hunger games or alice in borerlands. this series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. almost as if it was inspired by the parasite. it's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. the deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. this time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. the motive makes sense. it's not just filthy rich making poor fight.i liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. when it gets dark it really does get dark. i had a couple of people i was rooting for. my favorite character is player 001. i instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.all the actors have done great job. there are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the south korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. humor is well knitted.this is a must watch on netflix. i doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.	want watch thumbnail netflix looked like cheap money hiest rip off. trailer little intriqued i've fair share battle royale. watched glad did.this rip

100	9	BijeshNagesh	Stellar Storytelling	"as survival series go, ""squid game"" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a ""hunger games"", ""saw"", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. the show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.the stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. the parts where they delved into the human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... this part, more than anything else, made this korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.the show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow dong-hyuk hwang evaded all those loopholes and 'convenience zones'. he also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. the thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.jaeil jung's musical scoring more than 'made it work' where this series was concerned. he captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. that ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... that never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. these, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on imdb), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.a few negatives... there were no cameras in the restrooms. this particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. no cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another 'tricky' omission. the highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. however, these and a handful of other 'loopholes' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that's where the magic lay in this series.i highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original korean-language (non-dubbed) version. feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. that's how i watched ""squid game"" on netflix. the 'feel' was so much different than when i 'tested' a few minutes of the show in its english dub.being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. this series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. it also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.with netflix's ""squid game"" dong-hyuk hwang has made a 'dark' mark one won't soon forget. he proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. ""squid game"" had that in abundance, and made me feel like i was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. the show went deep into the primal nature of humankind instead of just showcasing our 'better nature'."

102	10	nagsaptarshi	Squid Game- Another Korean Gem	i am an ardent follower of the korean movies. even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies i have watched till date have not disappointed me. but i was a bit apprehensive of watching a korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. the very name squid game , the latest offering from netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. however, i risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. and boy! it has paid back. i cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. but if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, i could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. but squid game eventually turned me to a binge-watcher. it is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.it is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. squid game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. the level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. the raw violence and gore trademarks of the korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. in the age of super computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. but the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. how the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.the show is full of metaphors. it may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in south korea. the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. remember parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? squid game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the south korean society. few references to the illegal immigration from north korea are there, too.squid game in may ways is similar to one movie i watched long back- exam. there also the creator worked on the same concept and i liked that movie. but in squid game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. i simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. the lead actors especially lee jung-jae, park hae soo, jung ho-yeon are stunning. the old man (i could not google his name) was fascinating. the script is tight, gripping and addictive. the cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. the music matches with the spirit of the show. the creator hwang dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. but if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. this is going to make amends for the poor choices netflix has been making for sometime now. be a player, watch squid game.my rating - 9.5 out of 10.	ardent follower korean movies. even though movies laden violence, gore bloodbath, chills thrills movies watched till date disappointed me. bit apprehensive

114	5	ianwagnerwatches	Hollow Pop Art	*light spoilers of plot details*so, squid game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize, at the expense of the other participants' lives.now, that's all well and good. who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? however, this story paints the loves of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several glaring plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them never returned, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice what should be an international headline (except for one detective who decides to investigate it off the books, who conveniently informs noone of his investigation or wherabouts.as well, i couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: that all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them, and all participants are made aware of this fact, and despite that meaning that they and the people they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival. and yet, all of them act as if it isn't the case. only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 225 people killed before their very eyes decided that their problems weren't bad enough to warrant throwing their lives away in a game that only one person could survive. bulls**t. everyone with a family and loved ones, everybody who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they in fact had no reason to live or were going to die anyway, and that the only way normal life would be feasible is if they give the murder games another shot. who cares about the odds, amiright? furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. i don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor; but, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that at least one of them would die.there are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer like myself to ignore. without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. i watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole they could go. by the way, the last episode is damn near impossible to sit through and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists.if you don't give a good god damn about

116	5	bluefim	Far from a masterpiece but good enough	let me preface: no, i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. i have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, i can't wrap my head around the hype. many people bring up how it is similar to x game, book, movie, etc. so i'm thinking netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. it is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. also annoying is, yes, the vips act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.in summary, was it good? depends on personal taste. was it genius, unique, or without flaws? absolutely not. i didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. i'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.	let preface: no, random person coming complain something popular like argument lot fans show make defend it. seen many horror/thrillers including death game genre, thought mix fun moments boring ones, can't wrap head around hype. many people bring similar x game, book, movie, etc. i'm thinking netflix created way casual non-horror viewers get exposure thinking new innovating.complaints aside, first sixth episodes best second worst far ones somewhere between, really entire show like rollercoaster entertainment-wise me. watchable sure, certain characters (mainly cop) moronic protected plot could done away re-written. also annoying is, yes, vips act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring point game there's one winner.in summary, good? depends personal taste. genius, unique, without flaws? absolutely not. enjoy enough binge, made decent casual viewing. i'd suggest trying forming opinions rather listening others amazing terrible may be.	let preface  no  random person coming complain something popular like argument lot fans show make defend it  seen many horror thrillers including death game genre  thought mix fun moments boring ones  can t wrap head around hype  many people bring similar x game  book  movie  etc  i m thinking netflix created way casual non horror viewers get exposure thinking new innovating complaints aside  first sixth episodes best second worst far ones somewhere between  really entire show like rollercoaster entertainment wise me  watchable sure  certain characters  mainly cop  moronic protected plot could done away re written  also annoying is  yes  vips act horribly and  yes  everyone keeps ignoring point game there s one winner in summary  good  depends personal taste  genius  unique  without flaws  absolutely not  enjoy enough binge  made decent casual viewing  i d suggest trying forming opinions rather listening others amazing terrible may be 	['let', 'prefac', 'random', 'person', 'come', 'complain', 'someth', 'popular', 'like', 'argument', 'lot', 'fan', 'show', 'make', 'defend', 'seen', 'mani', 'horror', 'thriller', 'includ', 'death', 'game', 'genr', 'thought', 'mix', 'fun', 'moment', 'bore', 'one', 'wrap', 'head', 'around', 'hype', 'mani', 'peopl', 'bring', 'similar', 'x', 'game', 'book', 'movi', 'etc', 'think', 'netflix', 'creat', 'way', 'casual', 'non', 'horror', 'viewer', 'get', 'exposur', 'think', 'new', 'innov', 'complaint', 'asid', 'first', 'sixth', 'episod', 'best', 'second', 'worst', 'far', 'one', 'somewher', 'realli', 'entir', 'show', 'like', 'rollercoast', 'entertain', 'wise', 'watchabl', 'sure', 'certain', 'charact', 'mainli', 'cop', 'moron', 'protect', 'plot', 'could', 'done', 'away', 'written', 'also', 'annoy', 'ye', 'vip', 'act', 'horribl', 'ye', 'everyon', 'keep', 'ignor', 'point', 'game', 'one', 'winner', 'summari', 'good', 'depend', 'person', 'tast', 'geniu', 'uniqu', 'without', 'flaw', 'absolut', 'enjoy', 'enough', 'bing', 'made', 'decent', 'casual', 'view', 'suggest', 'tri', 'form', 'opinion', 'rather', 'listen', 'other', 'amaz', 'terribl', 'may']

126	5	maakus	Definitely not deserving of the high rating.	"first off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes ""kamisama no iu tôri."" it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.second: i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and i've always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese, but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. it's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.third: the vips... listen, south korean movie makers: stay away from ""actors"" from the west who moves to sk to try their luck because they were unemployable on the western market. they were horrible. just terrible.finally: squid game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the b plot and everything else. this series was way way way too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. the games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring."

129	5	Healing_Process	Another interesting story that I knew would crawl into the potent trope and hardcore stereotype Asian show.	"the show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. it quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. this is the asian concept that i put in my title that i thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.the first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. this is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. but many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.this is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. the games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. this makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.all instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then actually turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.i won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that i thought were reminiscent of the asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. but the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. but knowing netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further."

131	7	blackoutH	Aiming high, falling short	first of, i am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-english movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.the concept of squid game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.the main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no vfx are used and the sets were actually built.it starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.as we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.still i did enjoy it for the most part, i don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.	first of, glad see ongoing trend, non-english movies making way become global phenomenon reaching wider audience, allows us get fresh perspectives reality different nations around world.the concept squid game nothing new, bunch unsuspecting individuals getting caught game quickly learn might severe consequences;

185	5	ThatAnimeSnob	A dumb variant of death games	this show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what i think about it, i did so. it isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. that's what i did and i had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. this doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. i don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. it is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.for starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. this wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. it doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. the characters in game didn't. when you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. the second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. the protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. they are killed at random. the best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. it all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.this show is often compared to kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. squid game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. as such it's nothing special in the longrun.	show got lot buzz came lot people pressuring tell think it, so. long

218	5	forthatusage	Dissapointing ending	the plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to gi hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. i get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?and in the end i get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let gi hun wins, because he knows gi hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that gi hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. it will be more satisfying if gi hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?and how does gi hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? he didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..and i dont like it that gi hun left his plane in the end i mean for what? yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (if there is any) unless jun ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with gi hun's money and all the information that jun ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of jun ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..the acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only i just wish it has a better ending.	plot exciting.. keeps viewers edge seat.. ending rushed great.. final game chosen, squid game exciting especially 2 players .. make worse turned boring cliched knife fighting scene.. chosen exciting game great climax..in earlier part kinda weird sang woo showed caring side gi hun first game suddenly second game showed selfishness agreed team him.. get sang woo competitive win money seem looks gi hun threat still many opponents time..so showed sang woo's good side expose selfishness soon?and end get sang woo suddenly conscience finally let gi hun wins, knows gi hun nice guy make sure mother get somethingbut kinda boring gi hun nice kindhearted wants end everything edge winning let selfish sang woo lives...not sang woo everyone.. satisfying gi hun wins game fair square let sang woo killed masked staffand end irrational use sad emotional music mastermind explaining that.. suppose feel sorry forget evil truly is?and gi hun save loan sharks one whole year? didnt use money way settled debt them..and dont like gi hun left plane end mean what? yes game way get revenge match them..dont tell depressed one whole year suddenly heroic smart second season?

they know who he is and what he looks like. if he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the squid game coordinator. end scene. better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.	squid game deserves hype overall still marred glaring inconsistencies poor story-telling. one infer focus gi hun protagonist would least make final game, win it. would better given 10 mins first episode tell backstories gi hun, sang woo, sae byeok, ali, deok su mi hyeon, would appear equal chance winning. seven things compromise story are:1. organ harvesters planned entire operation cremation furnace floor dropped coffin room below. yet arrange surgeon pose staff member instead relied player dissect bodies exchange information next game.2. front man jun ho's missing older brother. would think could lied younger brother whereabouts paid advance rent. even renting place running squid game winner 2015 supposedly prize money?3. conclusion game 5, glass bridge blown tiny smithereens glass shard hits sae byeok size kitchen knife?4. less-than-convincing melee sang woo gi hun final game. gi hun unable finish game eliminate sang woo. sang woo suddenly finds conscience kills himself. completely inconsistent person sacrificed anyone way get ahead. anticlimax.5. gi hun mopes due survivor's guilt, leaving sang woo's mom saddled son's debt sae byeok's brother languishing orphanage whole year.6. squid game started 1988. hundreds people disappear seoul month every year raises eyebrows. collective missing person reports would trigger police looking cctv footage people would come across footage squid games recruiters.7. final scene sees gi hun turning away boarding flight see daughter america. presumably try get next squid games. exactly?

"this is a very strange series. it's like a cross between logan's run, the hunger games, lost, lord of the flies (not to mention m. c. escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. i grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of korean drama, i suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....but seriously...wtf!!!!!the dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original korean actors and the those doing the english dub. but even the scenes in english (the vips) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok. my score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. it made the show nearly unwatchable. maybe this makes more sense in the original korean and would have been better served by english subtitles. i don't know.i also question the premise for the show in the first place. yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? after the first round when they were allowed to leave, i find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. and how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their ""winnings"" from how they were acquired? and while the ""1 year later"" epilogue does cover this to some extent, i mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is gi-hun going to have? obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but i don't think i really care .also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. first you wonder how they explain all the deaths. then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone. and wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? i get it. it's a fantasy dystopian thing, but i was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.however, i liked the creepy use of tchaikowsky's waltz from ""serenade for strings"", strauss's ""blue danube"" and ""fly me to the moon"" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.but again, seriously......wtf!!!p. s. how again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?"

292	8	joncolley	Fantastic series let down by a slightly meh finale	"ok, i have to get this off my chest. it really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... i find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'i was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! go watch some tik tok videos instead!ok, rant over lol.i put this on for the sake of having something in the background while i worked from home. it was a huge mistake as i kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! sorry boss :) i did however change it to other ""stuff"" when i realised it was a show i wanted to watch.the basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. simples. what they don't know is that they might die...i don't know how they do it, but korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. they even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.anyway, i won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) it doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( i sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards."

296	7	nielssloos-17186	Almost perfect, but fails to stick to the bigger idea	squid games received a lot of buzz since it came out and it is easy to understand why. around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. the premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.and throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. and eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.when the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'the cabin in the woods'. and without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. and soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an american company (netflix) to produce such anti-american series. i just wish they stocked with this idea.unfortunately, and maybe i am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. and everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like the cabin in the woods ended. the anti american propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.pros: the games, the violence, references to inequalitycons: plot twist, predictability, ending.	squid games received lot buzz since came easy understand why. around 400 people financial problems decide join tournament, play kids games losers killed. premise similar franchises hunger games, violent movies became popular franchise.and throughout first couple episodes get kind adrenaline filled experiences: games silly due fact get killed loose automatically tension. eventhough pretty clear survive first games, audience still get want;

A 6 or 7 for me	"some of it was good, some of it very good, some of it not so good.my frowning moments were:*** spoiler alert **** when they started killing each other, 27 people in total: too soon and over the top. here i considered giving it 5 stars at most.* the ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* the english speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. all except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* the importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? nor did i understand the 1 winner only system. i don't recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could've been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). i personally think it would've been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could've shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. first of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. but foremostly because i just don't believe anyone except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. and they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. really, if i handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* melodrama on various occasions where less would've been more.* like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should've been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* i thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. he should have just done what he should've done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* the character developement of the main character was poor. he's a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. doesn't go see his daughter, doesn't share some of the money he won with the really poor. and his sudden change of morality just didn't ring true with me.but, having said all this, after seeing the similar series ""alice in borderland"", i have to say i thought this way better. it certainly had me hooked all the way through. so i'd still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. the cinematography was great. and - i came back to add this - it really was very colourful and creepy (those masks, with different ranks according to symbol, and the private island), and not mainstream, and very entertaining."

319	9	JTReviewsPlus	An interesting premise that's expertly crafted all around	"even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, squid game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. the former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. as for the latter, every character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. the group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show."

334	0	MNR87BPF	It was okay until the VIPs showed up	"first of all. i like korean cinema. memories of murder and burning are among my top 10 favorite films of all time.the show has been hyped everywhere and i actually didn't want to see it right away. but so many people told me to watch. so i watched.i try to make it simple and i don't make it up.i knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.i knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. it came to my mind instantly. he was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes i wanted to keep watching. but to me it was pretty predictable.every character did exactly what i expected in almost every situation. the bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. the crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. and so on.and this goes along with every thing in the show.examples:marble game again. there is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. he hangs himself. success. it would've been funnier if it didn't work and he had to keep playing. even though i know he wasn't an important character.the glass bridge game. the broker guy who also fooled ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. he pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. he jumps and wins. i would've loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. that would've been unexpected. he pushes the guy and thinks he's safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. wow. didn't happen.police guy trying to escape all the sudden. why so ever. he looked for his brother, couldn't find him and then leaves. they look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. they follow him. they see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. and what did he do ? he went diving. i would've like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. didn't happen.the whole show is just based on its whole premise. violence and shock. and bright classic music in weird situations. and that just repeats.to me it really went difficult when the 'vips' showed up. they were super cringeworthy. i couldn't barely watch and listen to their generic lines. and why would they come to almost the last game ? so they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. wow. they should've been introduced earlier. they weren't even needed at all. if you'd take them out it wouldn't have changed anything and it would've even be more mysterious in my opinion. i doesn't match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.and then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. right.. who cares about children. she can wait another year. stoopid kid.i also had a problem with the portrayal of the arab character. he was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. he didn't even know what even and odd numbers are. and his name was ali abdul. it's like having a french character and calling him 'guy frenchman'.however it was still a lot better than 80% of netflix stuff. and i will watch the second season if it comes. i also liked ""sweet home"" which is also a korean show with monsters and all around one house. it kind of went nowhere in the end, but i actually liked that one more."

349	4	Vinicius8	Funny Games	"the brand new hype series of the season. is it any good? with so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, i dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? if you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. i feel like ""squid game"" has been given too much credit, and i will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.a few users on imdb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, i could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. aside from the fact that i don't want to spoil the series, i think it's more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.to begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it's unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. we take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. and that's where the issues begin. i can happily ignore certain details about how all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. however, ""squid game"" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. is that a problem? not necessarily. take ""the platform"" for example: the absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. ""the platform"" doesn't dwell on the details of how it all came to be, or who is behind all of it. it doesn't matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our's and the movie's reality. then how does ""the platform"" differ from ""squid game""? in favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in ""squid game"". for example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: how did those people end up there? now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. and guess what? they never get one.that problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. when they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. if they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn't go the authors' way. that would create conflicts the writers wouldn't know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.the way i see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.as a metaphor, ""squid game"" could've worked not unlike the aforementioned ""the platform"", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.as a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as ""alice in borderland"". the realism wouldn't matter then and the mystery would be stronger.as a realistic show we would have something like ""saló or 120 days of sodom"". and it should've felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. but that doesn't seem the point ""squid game"" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. but hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? you are just as bad as those evil men! you are enjoying this show too! but no, ""squid game"" doesn't confront you with that notion, like michael haneke did with ""funny games"". you are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. are you satisfied? don't worry about answering that. keep yourself busy. watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question."

370	7	Mauseum	Solid	"squid game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. from 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. episode 6 was my favourite. episode 7 onwards with the vip's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. i feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as i'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.a couple of reasons why i'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. this contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. i also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. i also found the death of sae-byeok to be a let down as i believed she deserved a better ending.overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.p. s. would you play?"

376	6	bruninho-loopes	Weak	first off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. it is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). the problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.there is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. after the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. as i said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues i found with it. (attention: spoilers):what are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? seriously, i think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.they talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very owner of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely not providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. also, the dude with the tattoo got multiple benefits throughout the show. here are a few:1. when someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. however, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. however, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)3. whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the vips with more entertaining value in the finale. when tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. seriously?anyways, back to the regular stuff:the plot, as i previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. it was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. and they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. do you think your audience is that stupid?there is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. no matter what happens, you always know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. in the marble contest, again, they had multiple opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. you can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.another ridiculous plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in the middle of the ocean. that scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.are you telling me that ali, a guy who came all the way from pakistan to live in south korea actually managed to learn how to speak korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? really? seriously?and then there is the ending. so, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? the dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a john wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? what a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.there are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. however, since this review is already long enough, i'm going to leave it here.very mediocre show. worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).	first off, show worth watch, despite rating it. entertaining gets hooked (though definitely get hanging edge seat). problem is: plot weak, riddled clichés, full plot holes.there thing surprising plot twist show. first couple episodes, already know exactly going happen. said, okay watch nothing else see, but, honest opinion, super undeserving 8+ rating worth hype.here's small, limited, list issues found it. (attention: spoilers):what odds that, group 201 people, would make vote vote would split exactly half, last one vote tie-breaker? seriously, think odds vote ending 101 100 less likely odds show like existing real life.they talk big game strive provide space equal everyone, even apologetic something go according rule. well, sorry say, allow owner criminal organization play games suffer consequences loses, absolutely providing fair leveled playing field everyone. also, dude tattoo got multiple benefits throughout show. few:1. someone threatened kill another player, would instantly face threat killed show staff. however, tattoo dude kills someone front staff, suffers consequence whatsoever.2. tattoo guy agreed play marbles game one way. however, started lose, cried foul staff actually allowed change game (seriously, ridiculous plot armor him)3. whenever someone refused play game, would instantly face consequences, people needed keep playing provide vips entertaining value finale. tattoo dude refuses play glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens him. seriously?anyways, back regular stuff:the plot, previously mentioned, constantly obvious easy guess. everyone knew smart dude would become villain, everyone knew lady find partner marble contest would left alive, everyone knew tattoo dude going lose marble game incredible, unbreakable plot armor history. also obvious heck competition pairs going make one character play other. acted like like huge plot twists. think audience stupid?there real tension leaves hanging edge seat throughout show main characters ones thoroughly explored, either love hate them. matter happens, always know team protagonist going win, always figure going win lose contests. marble contest, again, multiple opportunities actually

completely unnecessary broke immersion show even more.are telling ali, guy came way pakistan live south korea actually managed learn speak korean, one difficult languages non-native speakers, flawlessly perfectly, know even odd numbers were? really? seriously?and ending. so, show going tell stupid main character, absolutely nothing throughout show, even manage win himself, going take whole criminal organization even island? dude going go jackass can't even wipe butt lives mother's money 30s john wick type guy destroy anything touches? terrible ending severely underwhelming show.there

399	10	bradleycarrington	Masterfully crafted Story about human nature and desperation	the three things that i look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. squid game passes all of those with flying colors. the storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. going into this, i thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was i wrong. this show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. there isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the vip's that spoke english) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional rollercoaster. lastly, i'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. i can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because i didn't catch a single inconsistency. it seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.this show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. it feels authentic from start to finish. definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.	three things look watching something storytelling, performance, attention detail. squid game passes flying colors. storytelling atmosphere incredible, well thought-out, keeps invested start finish. going this, thought show deadly children's games would get cheesy points, boy wrong. show digs deep psyche characters delivers powerful emotional scenes, actors absolutely nail. much say acting actors (with exception vip's spoke english) deliver phenomenal performances take emotional rollercoaster. lastly, i'm type person pause shows spot inconsistencies plot holes telling seriously creators took show/movie. tell invested everyone worked catch single inconsistency. seemed like every single detail thought carefully crafted.this show brutal, bleak, sugar coat anything deliver corny cliche's. feels authentic start finish. definitely feel good show faint heart, would absolutely recommend giving watch.	three things look watching something storytelling  performance  attention detail  squid game passes flying colors  storytelling atmosphere incredible  well thought out  keeps invested start finish  going this  thought show deadly children s games would get cheesy points  boy wrong  show digs deep psyche characters delivers powerful emotional scenes  actors absolutely nail  much say acting actors  with exception vip s spoke english  deliver phenomenal performances take emotional rollercoaster  lastly  i m type person pause shows spot inconsistencies plot holes telling seriously creators took show movie  tell invested everyone worked catch single inconsistency  seemed like every single detail thought carefully crafted this show brutal  bleak  sugar coat anything deliver corny cliche s  feels authentic start finish  definitely feel good show faint heart  would absolutely recommend giving watch 	['three', 'thing', 'look', 'watch', 'someth', 'storytel', 'perform', 'attent', 'detail', 'squid', 'game', 'pass', 'fli', 'color', 'storytel', 'atmospher', 'incred', 'well', 'thought', 'keep', 'invest', 'start', 'finish', 'go', 'thought', 'show', 'deadli', 'children', 'game', 'would', 'get', 'cheesi', 'point', 'boy', 'wrong', 'show', 'dig', 'deep', 'psych', 'charact', 'deliv', 'power', 'emot', 'scene', 'actor', 'absolut', 'nail', 'much', 'say', 'act', 'actor', 'except', 'vip', 'spoke', 'english', 'deliv', 'phenomen', 'perform', 'take', 'emot', 'rollercoast', 'lastli', 'type', 'person', 'paus', 'show', 'spot', 'inconsist', 'plot', 'hole', 'tell', 'serious', 'creator', 'took', 'show', 'movi', 'tell', 'invest', 'everyon', 'work', 'catch', 'singl', 'inconsist', 'seem', 'like', 'everi', 'singl', 'detail', 'thought', 'care', 'craft', 'show', 'brutal', 'bleak', 'sugar', 'coat', 'anyth', 'deliv', 'corni', 'clich', 'feel', 'authent', 'start', 'finish', 'definit', 'feel', 'good', 'show', 'faint', 'heart', 'would', 'absolut', 'recommend', 'give', 'watch']

419	7	Starlitelet	Great suspense throughout, but the ending was not worth it.	the show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.the characters don't make sense, especially gi eun and sang woo. their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.since when was gi eun so heroic? ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? i really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. he is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so i don't get what he's thinking to go back. what is he going to do anyway? who told him to sign up for them, not once, but twice?since when did sang woo feel remorseful? it's not within his character to stab himself. he didn't even feel bad when he let ali die or when he killed sae byeok.the reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. it has been done a million times already.we also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly front man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.i had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.in retrospect, i think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. the actors did a fine job, and i think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. the plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like money heist. ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. if it had ended similarly to parasite, where gi eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. but this ending? cheap.6.5.	show hooks right away first episode, climax comes play along supposedly plot twists revealed, realize show took cheap easy route.the characters make sense, especially gi eun sang woo. character developments change drastically nowhere makes sense, especially towards end.since gi eun heroic?

469	10	asdfqaz123	Only possible outside of Hollywood	this is the bravest, most intelligent show i've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. there's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.the first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. it uses the the korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. this makes watching the series so much more relatable.another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. the depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a hollywood film. i personally felt the pain for the father.the fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.overall, i feel this series is deep and thought provoking. it blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. so, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. i think that's the message from the filmmakers.	bravest, intelligent show i've seen years, absolutely blown away thoughtfulness script. there's many layers script, one parent/son/bread winner/unemployed truly appreciate full depth it.the first layer puts modern slavery that's known debt. uses korean household debt crisis backdrop rather made excuse like sci-fi film. makes watching series much relatable.another layer worth mentioning father saying goodbye daughter. depiction realistic poignant, none overacting typically seen hollywood film. personally felt pain father.the fact characters act according free adds another layer plot. ultimately, series ugly side human nature. nobody forces us anything push comes shove, often brings worst us, side never knew existed.overall, feel series deep thought provoking. blends real social issues fantasy thrills without going overboard. though may survival games like real world, still quite true debt make person vulnerable. so, spare thought someone around who's financial needs offer help. think that's message filmmakers.	bravest  intelligent show i ve seen years  absolutely blown away thoughtfulness script  there s many layers script  one parent son bread winner unemployed truly appreciate full depth it the first layer puts modern slavery that s known debt  uses korean household debt crisis backdrop rather made excuse like sci fi film  makes watching series much relatable another layer worth mentioning father saying goodbye daughter  depiction realistic poignant  none overacting typically seen hollywood film  personally felt pain father the fact characters act according free adds another layer plot  ultimately  series ugly side human nature  nobody forces us anything push comes shove  often brings worst us  side never knew existed overall  feel series deep thought provoking  blends real social issues fantasy thrills without going overboard  though may survival games like real world  still quite true debt make person vulnerable  so  spare thought someone around who s financial needs offer help  think that s message filmmakers 	['bravest', 'intellig', 'show', 'seen', 'year', 'absolut', 'blown', 'away', 'thought', 'script', 'mani', 'layer', 'script', 'one', 'parent', 'son', 'bread', 'winner', 'unemploy', 'truli', 'appreci', 'full', 'depth', 'first', 'layer', 'put', 'modern', 'slaveri', 'known', 'debt', 'use', 'korean', 'household', 'debt', 'crisi', 'backdrop', 'rather', 'made', 'excus', 'like', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'make', 'watch', 'seri', 'much', 'relat', 'anoth', 'layer', 'worth', 'mention', 'father', 'say', 'goodby', 'daughter', 'depict', 'realist', 'poignant', 'none', 'overact', 'typic', 'seen', 'hollywood', 'film', 'person', 'felt', 'pain', 'father', 'fact', 'charact', 'act', 'accord', 'free', 'add', 'anoth', 'layer', 'plot', 'ultim', 'seri', 'ugli', 'side', 'human', 'natur', 'nobodi', 'forc', 'us', 'anyth', 'push', 'come', 'shove', 'often', 'bring', 'worst', 'us', 'side', 'never', 'knew', 'exist', 'overal', 'feel', 'seri', 'deep', 'thought', 'provok', 'blend', 'real', 'social', 'issu', 'fantasi', 'thrill', 'without', 'go', 'overboard', 'though', 'may', 'surviv', 'game', 'like', 'real', 'world', 'still', 'quit', 'true', 'debt', 'make', 'person', 'vulner', 'spare', 'thought', 'someon', 'around', 'financi', 'need', 'offer', 'help', 'think', 'messag', 'filmmak']

476	6	whiskeymovie	Could have been an 8 or 9	"first, i will start by saying; this is not an original idea. it's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. most recently the hunt comes to mind, and i think i enjoyed that more.this was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. that's where they hit their stride.this show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. it would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole detective story line.i think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. i mean 6 games, 6 episodes. makes sense.oh, and i get that all of us americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. i wasn't offended by it, i just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.i hate watching dubbed, so i always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking english. and yeah. i think they threw a chinese guy and russian guy into the vip mix, but it just felt off.then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). but the ending. as someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, i had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. hmm? and then when you don't actually see him get shot i was like, yup, he's behind it. that's a fine ""twist"", but my god, his ""explanation"" was awful. and the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. it's the kind of twist i felt like they came up with at the last minute.then the whole front man/ cop brother thing i saw coming too. but i wish i didn't as there was no resolution on it. yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. i wasn't feeling that.and actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and i felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed gi hun just being like you're a bad man. and then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? and that was the catalyst for gi hun to get a makeover to go to la and go on rupauls darg race, i mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? and then he just bails and is like, no. katniss needs me as tribute and i'm going back to the hunt to survive the game of the hard target hunger games battle royale style.and it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized korean annie lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just happened to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. i guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the honeycomb?also, what happened to the whole bit about the morse code through cough? was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?and when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was i doing yesterday? and the people jist answer him without being wtf?and last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. i wasn't a huge fan of that.all in all, it was good, but could have been great."

And no one would talk about it	season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.this series expresses an aspect of korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless statea recent korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. similar kind of movies are something that korean society seems to enjoy. watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. it is not the vips that are making this game play and them enjoying it. it the well feed society of korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. america has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist north. completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soask yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. people killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. how cruel it is.series showed that this game is played for many decades.. seriously.. no flaws in it? wasn't there korean bruce lee or rambo to save the day? all this years and no one detected it? every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. so don't people should know that elimination means being killed? it's only after round 1 does people know about it. rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. rule of rules is not followed. round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.one day before i read in news of best and topmost reputation from uk, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. but there main topic in the news was that the english subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent korean dialogue. again seriously.. why would a english knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. we are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. many korean who knows english well enough have to say this about subtitles. how will it affect? by getting better appreciation? answer from me is no!apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. it seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. the colors the dresser the clean act except of course by vips.i enjoyed the series but i am sorry, the meaning of korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think.	season 1 rated 8. 7 make another.this series expresses aspect korean movie culture, wants show people worst poor helpless statea recent korean movie got famous, showed people live home others without getting detected. similar kind movies something korean society seems enjoy. watch destituteness helplessness urban poor. vips making game play enjoying it. well feed society korea wants enjoy others lesser means survival present capitalistic society getting ripped basic necessities living. america done part making society completely opposite communist north. completely filled big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go place plastic surgeries, soask yourself, society would large crowd would gather colosseum watch gladiators killing others right front. people killing other, getting killed one survivor. cruel is.series showed game played many decades.. seriously.. flaws it?

"watching squid game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie ""would you rather"". same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. the mc's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. he also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. the police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during pandemic. hopefully, if season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work."

576	7	josechr	Worth your time	squid game is a korean mystery/thriller tv-series about a group of people selected to participate in a sinister game of survival.every participant is selected because they are out of luck and in debt, and desperate enough to do what it takes to escape their fate in the outside world.we follow deadbeat dad and gambling addict seong gi-hun, as he continue to fall into bottomless debt, and after a fateful late night gamble at the subway, gets an invitation to a final game where everything will change.what follows is a series of games, where the stakes are final if you lose, but the price is a chance to redeem yourself financially and for some, morally.the show is really nothing more, or less, than a solid script, with no forced finger pointing or animosity based on race or sex. there are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. there's no bigotry outside of that, which u. s. tv-shows are unable to write or make anymore.it's exciting, but there is a certain amount of over-acting and a bit of melodrama that can be somewhat grating to a western palate, but when the script is that good and engaging, it's easy enough to stomach. other than the aforemented, the actors do a stellar job.it has some flaws of course. it's not groundbreaking or terribly original in it's constituant parts, but as a whole, it works perfectly fine for what it is.it's well shot, well paced, engaging, but with some overplaying that draws you out of the story a bit, as mentioned. overall an enjoyable, exciting and somewhat gory and bloody good series, with added societal criticism and a message that doesn't label any specific demographic as inherently evil.	squid game korean

but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.it's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.i see a few here complaining about vip acting, i have no clue what that is, but i found the acting overall very good.i don't speak korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average saw-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. subtle messaging abounds. for your consideration.the design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful escher and minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.with star wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. under a hierarchy based on shapes and a vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.and that's where the old boy feeling really kicks in. is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?overall, i would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.can't really say any more until i'm done watching it all.but i'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.or it should be. especially given the work gone into this.thanks for reading.	binged watched 4 episodes row. amazing!extraordinarily original fresh. feelings old boy, parasite japan's battle royale, course hints black mirror (the title graphics make clear) -

623	6	coeluracat	Not very Original	as per my title this isn't a very original idea. it's been done time and time again: highlander (1986), battle royale (2000), the hunger games (2012), animal world (2018) etc. the only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.i tried to watch this when it first appeared on netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when i found something better to binge watch. after seeing all the hype about it i decided to give it another go, perhaps i should have given it 4 episodes? nope it still didn't impress.i have to question the '111 million fans' claim by netflix. i'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. viewings do not correspond to fans.the acting is your usual frenetic korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.the main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'there can be only one' (to quote highlander) winner at the end of the game.my only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'squid game' and who the 'frontman' was. the clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.i suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.i gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of netflix's underwhelming prior offerings.	per title original idea. done time time again: highlander (1986), battle royale (2000), hunger games (2012), animal world (2018) etc. difference venue/place held winnings end.i tried watch first appeared netflix, 3 episodes still impressed me, quickly forgotten found something better binge watch. seeing hype decided give another go, perhaps given 4 episodes?

644	7	MsAce	VIPs from The Masked Singer Cannot Act	it's an interesting concept for sure. but the scene where the vips arrived looking like they were ready to perform in the masked singer is just so dumb.plus rows of identical cars boarding a ferry at night seems like the kind of thing that would get flagged as suspicious.and the cop not calling for backup? running directly in the line of sight of the rear view mirror. a game that has been going on for years and yet no security at the gates. choosing to go at it alone. risking it all for his 1 kidney brother. that's just senseless.evading the armed troops in a labyrinth littered with cameras is also senseless.i felt like the revelation of the anarchy rule in the dorms was a bit rushed. a small guy attacking a thug with a freaking face tattoo while he was with his group of thugs is something that i do not see happening. then the small guy dying so quickly.given that you can just kill each other in the dorm, deok-su could have killed mi-nyeo with his bare hands but he didn't.back to the vips. they are my main gripe. the awful script. goodness gracious. i had to pause every few lines because it was just abysmal.i thought the painted naked people were unnecessary.all that aside i did enjoy the show overall. the games were simple yet creative. and i always love a good tug of war.i thought they did good by restarting the contest with those who chose to come back eyes wide open. you feel less for them since they chose their own destiny.the story was also insightful. the portrayal of gambling addiction. predatory lending in south korea. the concept of throwing good money at bad and going for broke. chasing the ever elusive dream of winning big money. i also liked how they covered the topic of religious hypocrisy.i loved the characters they created.massive spoilers below.it was obvious who the stronger guy was. he is also exponentially smarter. yet somehow at the end he was a flailing idiot who could not anticipate obvious moves from the offensive and instead just attacking widly. makes no sense.it was a bit too obvious who the finalists would be.and it was a bit obvious that the old man was in on it when they did not show his death. tried a bit too hard to be poetic at the end.but gi-hun coming out looking like freaking party poison at the end was hilarious.the fact that he took the kid and just gave him to the old woman was such a typical useless dad thing to do.leaving his mother without a caretaker, is a typical useless son thing to do. always with the grand noble intentions. far too little, far too late.then turning his back on his daughter, is really typical also.if you are a bad son, and a bad father, all the money in the world cannot change that. just because you are not evil does not mean that you are a good person.	interesting concept sure. scene vips arrived looking like ready perform masked singer dumb.plus rows identical cars boarding ferry night seems like kind thing

648	4	kowstoff	Predictable plot, and not original.	i don't get the hype for this show, honestly. it's very predictable, and it doesn't feel original. i just feel like i was watching one of the ''saw'' movies. however, i like the idea behind the show in an apparent criticism of capitalism society and billionaires in general. it can be a very tough reality to confront, but this show portraits the bad side of capitalism in a very depressing and violent way, as it should be.on the other hand, it's not that hard to criticize capitalism, it's actually a very easy target. it's almost a trend these days, with all other tv shows and movies addressing this topic. i'm not saying it is bad to address this topic at all. i'm really glad this is being discussed, i just feel that this topic isn't enough to make this show original or surprising in any aspect. it's surely not a virtue of this show.squid game tries to build tension on violence and death, just like got did. but got's tension is genuine, well-built, and really unpredictable (unless you read the books). the tension here is almost useless, since we all know how this is going to end, and the characters death become almost trivial throughout the show. we know who will likely win and who won't. sure, there are some surprises/plot twists along the way regarding the characters, but it's not that mind-blowing anyway.violence scenes are excellent! it's raw, straightforward and merciless. i also liked the cliffhanger in the end. i like how the main character wasn't conformed with all the violent events, and how he evolved to a more mature and dangerous person.the first season of squid game didn't impress me, but there's room to improve in possible future seasons. this show needs another season, not only because of the cliffhanger, but the narrative needs a better outcome, and the main character deserves a better legacy.	get hype show, honestly. predictable, feel original. feel like watching one ''saw'' movies. however, like idea behind show apparent criticism capitalism society billionaires general. tough reality confront, show portraits bad side capitalism depressing violent way, be.on hand, hard criticize capitalism, actually easy target. almost trend days, tv shows movies addressing topic. i'm saying bad address topic all. i'm really glad discussed, feel topic enough make show original surprising aspect. surely virtue show.squid game tries build tension violence death, like got did. got's tension genuine, well-built, really unpredictable (unless read books). tension almost useless, since know going end, characters death become almost trivial throughout show. know likely win won't. sure, surprises/plot twists along way regarding characters, mind-blowing anyway.violence scenes excellent!

698	6	raffydibansa	Poor Choices	we make poor choices in life. that's the truth. but we must learn from them.this show is about a man, gi hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. that's the first episode. instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.this show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. which makes it... nonsense. completely.i'll explain why. from the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for gi hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. he's gambling-addict i get that. but to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that gi hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, gi hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. but after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.this is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.it gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. as some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.fairness is thrown out the window.rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.one ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?in the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. poor choices.	make poor choices life. that's truth. must learn them.this show man, gi hun, really luck plain stupid. that's first episode. instead buying present daughter chose gamble

713	8	be23zE	Great Fun but Don't Forget the Message	"squid game: it's everywhere. it is almost inescapable at this point. there are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. i was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. and, to be honest, squid game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.this is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let's begin by getting my complaints out of the way. firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but i understand why. squid game is a netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of harikari or departures. this was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. surprisingly, it's not that big of a deal. it works in a similar way to disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and mickey mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.one example of the aforementioned pandering are the god awful flashbacks. when gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the united states with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. i mean come on. how stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? we also have the front man's reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. i mean, i guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but i'm sure that star wars-luke, i am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. but let's not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. i laughed my ass of during that scene.which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn't detract much from the plot. aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the m. night shyamalan ""twists"" can be seen coming a mile away.with that said, there's really not a lot to complain about here. squid game is addicting. i watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if i did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then i watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and i already want to watch the show again. why? two reasons: it is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and easter eggs scattered throughout.so while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. the games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in korea. think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. they even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. this is a genius mechanism that i will get back to in a second. so the players are caged animals here. behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. don't you think some rich asshole funded this movie? the premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called ""democratic"" nations. we slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let's say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. we are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the vips.this brings me back to the voting system. the players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. we can't stop working or we will become homeless and die. but we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next elon musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love elon musk. they worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).yeah, yeah. i know, i know. i got political. it's a touchy subject but it's true and squid game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.anyway, i don't really need to recommend this show to anyone. you're most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like i did. many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so i wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. it's obviously a great show and you will probably see it."

(because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?the leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if i'm correct, nothing came of this? i was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?one of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? i was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. bit disappointed with that.how did that annoying woman survive? when asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? but she was a weak underdog? that makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?the police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), i kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.another police man one... he was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. his brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. how does this work? or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. this definitely needed more explanation.now that i think about it, there were a lot of plot holes, but during watching it and before i started analysing it, i thoroughly enjoyed it.i would recommend and likely watch again! i love geeking out like this; that's how i know when i've loved something; when i can't stop thinking and analysing it!"

"first of all, i'll talk about what i like! the concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.other characters not so much, there's an edgy north korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. ""i don't trust people"" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, i dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.the dubbing is also awful, i don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.i'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10."

884	6	Delta4220	Incredible start, horrible finish	first five episodes are incredible.you get a mysterious setting with characters to which anyone can relate to, even if you are not a few million in debt.after the first five episodes however, things begin to crumble.you start getting fed information about the whole mystery which ruins the viewer's expectations as things like this are best left unknown.the whole plot line of the side cop cho sang-woo who is looking for his brother and is trying to bring the games down is absolutely pointless, he accomplished nothing, only to find out that his own brother is pulling the strings.he dodges compromised guards, disgusting forced gay interactions and runs like a wild animal, outswimming a gps tracker underwater. one would think that they would at least see him passing them on the gps tracker.the old man il-nam who's ganbu tries to trick him in order to live, comes back from the dead, only to reveal nothing. his whole buildup and emotion during that episode where he initially dies is absolutely destroyed by having him be a plot twist vip at the end.the rewatchability continues to crumble with each plot point.the games go from actual logic and quick thinking to absolute chance and stupidity. an entire character, kang sae-byeok dies from a level getting self destroyed? like why? why do you kill off a character in such a meaningless way. yes sang-woo finishes her off, but brings absolutely nothing to the show. she would have had 5 minutes tops from the incredible blood loss due to a huge glass shard ending her.yes the american vips are trash and the dialogue sucks, but they are not the worst part.the last final epic game that kids play in teams is decided to be a 1v1 as it's the show's epic name. squid game.the most boring ending game to have a 1v1 with. would be a hundred times more entertaining if they added more people to it, as it's meant to be played.and to top it all off after our main protagonist gets out of there he is so shocked that he is late to treat his mother and she dies, that he absolutely forgets about his daughter, his friend's mother who somehow did not get her shop taken, as it was mentioned that his friend bet his mother's shop and the young girl kang's little brother.it takes him a year to actually act and do something, because the old man reaches out to him and meets him one last time.and instead of meeting his daughter to be a good father for once in his life, like he earlier mentions a few times, he decides to be the big strong man and take the games down which had him mentally broken for a year.i understand that he did not want to spend the money, but at least take care of your friend's mom and a little boy. he could have even given a hand to ali's family after he saved his life.when you get such an incredible start and so much potential in the beginning, it's not easy to keep up the quality. the actors played absolutely fantastic ,but the writers just did not handle those episodes well enough which pretty much ruins the buildup of the previous episodes.	first five episodes incredible.you get mysterious setting characters anyone relate to, even million

886	10	angelanicole-68272	Horrifying and fantastic	i continue to be impressed by korean shows and movies. i really love them. this is a great show that i hope will go on. the characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. i felt so many emotions watching this; i was moved. one of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between gi-hun and sang-woo. the tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. i also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the frontman and the whole organization.i thought the tug-of-war challenge was the most disturbing one. to think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.if i had to add some critique, i would agree with other reviews about the vips. their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. but they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating.	continue impressed korean shows movies. really love them. great show hope go on. characters excellent, games anxiety-inducing scary, dying see what's next, actual character development takes place throughout. felt many emotions watching this; moved. one biggest highlights relationship gi-hun sang-woo. tension built time subtlety first, story whole done nicely. also really liked undercover cop/brother frontman, heartbroken story ended way did. everything find brother, happened really made disgusted frontman whole organization.i thought tug-of-war challenge disturbing one. think would feel standing one side rope knowing yank group people death done makes wince.if add critique, would agree reviews vips. acting horrible fit rest show. big enough element really affect rating.	continue impressed korean shows movies  really love them  great show hope go on  characters excellent  games anxiety inducing scary  dying see what s next  actual character development takes place throughout  felt many emotions watching this  moved  one biggest highlights relationship gi hun sang woo  tension built time subtlety first  story whole done nicely  also really liked undercover cop brother frontman  heartbroken story ended way did  everything find brother  happened really made disgusted frontman whole organization i thought tug of war challenge disturbing one  think would feel standing one side rope knowing yank group people death done makes wince if add critique  would agree reviews vips  acting horrible fit rest show  big enough element really affect rating 	['continu', 'impress', 'korean', 'show', 'movi', 'realli', 'love', 'great', 'show', 'hope', 'go', 'charact', 'excel', 'game', 'anxieti', 'induc', 'scari', 'die', 'see', 'next', 'actual', 'charact', 'develop', 'take', 'place', 'throughout', 'felt', 'mani', 'emot', 'watch', 'move', 'one', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'relationship', 'gi', 'hun', 'sang', 'woo', 'tension', 'built', 'time', 'subtleti', 'first', 'stori', 'whole', 'done', 'nice', 'also', 'realli', 'like', 'undercov', 'cop', 'brother', 'frontman', 'heartbroken', 'stori', 'end', 'way', 'everyth', 'find', 'brother', 'happen', 'realli', 'made', 'disgust', 'frontman', 'whole', 'organ', 'thought', 'tug', 'war', 'challeng', 'disturb', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'feel', 'stand', 'one', 'side', 'rope', 'know', 'yank', 'group', 'peopl', 'death', 'done', 'make', 'winc', 'add', 'critiqu', 'would', 'agre', 'review', 'vip', 'act', 'horribl', 'fit', 'rest', 'show', 'big', 'enough', 'element', 'realli', 'affect', 'rate']

906	6	gianmarcocibella	Could have been gold	when i first heard about this show, the first thing that came to my mind was money heist. and not exactly a robbery with a lot of unnecesary extra seasons. i thought huge budget spend on set, cgi and entertainment while the dialogue and storyline is given to the bunch of guys who knows how to do a lame predictible money maker series.i gave it a try and after watching the first episodes i started to think that i might made a judgement mistake.for a moment i was caught in it's mistery, unpredictable events and complex moral issues. you get to judge the competitors while at the same time realize you would probably do the same monstrosity's they are commiting. you see great acting, scenes that make you fantasize abouth the old days in south korea when all of them where playing these infantile games without their debts, guilt and traumas. even tough i'm no korean and never been in korea, i felt nostalgia.then, the show starts to have a few flaws in matters of coherence wich you try to ignore to keep having a pleasent experience. and for moments, you do. you try to understand the unnecesary plot about the young police who extremely easily breaks into a secret, dangerous facility runned by a cruel, wealthy organization who seem to have been running this games without problem for at least 2 decades. if that's not enough, the showrunners give you a terrible, incoherent explanation about his missing brother. it's almost like the tape of the series came by mistake with a few mission impossible scenes in the middle of it.there's a few scenes and cliché dialogues that makes you wonder if the series is looking to play safe as another hit in terms of netflix views, or more as the daring, complex drama that was, at least, what i was expecting it to be.my other problem was that after 5 episodes i realized i wasn't empathizing too much with the characthers (with the exception of competitor 001, of course).and then i arrived at the climax of the series. episode 6. the moral concept is taken way beyond in this game as competitors pick their closest partner without knowing that they're gonna have to eliminate each other. you get to see the real face of all the characthers and the cast best perfomances. there's a lot of betrayal, hesitation, tension, characther exploration and development, and of course, the heartbreaking endings to each of the main eliminations. it was a perfect ending for jy-yeong, ali and the old beloved 001.after that perfect episode, you are blown back to reality and the shows

"this was a great representation of how the world revolves around money and capitalism. it shows our modern day society in a brutal yet true way.some scenes might be shocking for some audiences but it really puts your mind in a situation to think and see things in a more realistic way.people who are desperate for money are willing to do whatever it takes to take them, even die, betray and kill other people. it shows how everyone's true nature comes to the surface in the attempt to gain money. yet the rich entertain themselves on the sight of desperation and think of these people as ""horses"" as they said that are just a piece in a game and their life doesn't worth anything more than to entertain them.this is the true nature of capitalism and our society. the richest man who created the games out of his boredom who thinks so less of poor people that are nothing more than pieces in his game, to the other rich people who just enjoy the games, to the head of the games, to the workers who are working for them and just obeying orders and who are also divided hierarchically and lastly to the players of the game who mean nothing. on top of that the head of the games continuously speaking of equality during the games giving them a false sense of equality when it actually doesn't exist because the rich are always worth more than them. so they create a false sense of security that every works out equally for everyone so they don't realize the real inequality that exists and that the only ones they have to turn against is each other.if we put this in our society, the people who hold all the wealth and can control the world, to the people who benefit from them like big companies etc, to the people working for them and obeying orders (working force who are slightly more advantaged than the players but also hierarchically divided like ceos, managers, employees, etc ) to the less fortunate who struggle and are taken advantage of for the sake of the rich gaining more money and apart from that their life means nothing.i would definitely recommend it if someone wants to take a deeper look and don't just stay at the surface of the games."

942	7	AstelleVey	A blast to watch mixed with disappointment	"i enjoy watching a lot of death game movies and shows similar to squid game, so when i heard its popularity i was instantly intrigued, not only was it so talked about, but it had really high critic scores. now, i try my best to not have ratings or my expectations to cloud my judgement when watching, so that's not the reason why i think squid game is only a 7/10.with all the other content i've seen with similar foundations, this one stands out. not only is it a series with a high budget, but it's korean. i'm not well knowledgeable in the korean culture, it's film/show industry or it's childlike games, but i was definitely shocked when watching this. most western content i've seen usually has low budget and pretty weak acting, but this is the complete opposite here. these well written characters were so easily brought to life by everyone....except the vips but i'm sure everyone knows how bad they are. not only was the acting incredible, but the accompanying score and visuals made it so this show was so excellently crafted.the main plot of squid game is relatively simple. there are people who need to pay debt and so they play games to win a lot of money, nothing original. they get tested/challenged by someone, who randomly goes up to them, targeting them, to see if they are worthy enough to enter their competition of children's games. this test is simple, play ddakji. winner pays the other 100k won. since the player cannot afford it after they lose, the businessman slaps them instead, and they keep going. the test here is, will the player keep on gambling the money they don't have. if so, then they get handed a business card, containing the number to call if they accept the invitation. so already, the start shows us how these games will work out, you're gambling something so heavy for something you so desperately need in return. so when they're on the island, they play 6 games over 6 days, death happens every time, you get the idea. i think it's here i should mention, there is a background meaning to a lot of this. the front man sometimes mentions about equality. however, if we take this morality of this, some events just don't match up. the biggest example i can think of is the bridge with glass tiles. this was so incredibly stupid that it was here (well before with the vips]) that started the train wreck of the show. in the other games, if you had a choice, you still were able to win:-choosing the shape for ppopgi, despite being at a huge disadvantage for choosing the umbrella, it is still possible to beat it.-choosing teams for tug of war, even if you have a weaker time, you can have strategy to win-choosing the pair for the marbles, we saw many ways how this could be done, either manipulation, gambling, or skill, yet you still had a fair chance if you knew what you were doing. even one guy playing used the morality of equality to try and increase his chances of winning because he knew that's how the games work.-but then you have the glass bridge. the commentary by the vips in the show were indeed correct. going straight at the front and straight at the back are both disadvantages, which is true. however, the people at the front so clearly have a disadvantage that's it's basically impossible to win if you're in the first 9 people. sure, there could have been strategies thought of to test each glass, but for games that made it so you still have a chance no matter what you pick, this is a bit out of place. oh and that glass explosion at the end is incredibly stupid. tbf this whole game is stupid, were they really gambling their entire playercount on 1 game? we know this is for entertainment after all, as they even decided to make the bridge harder last second. what's so entertaining about all your players dying at once?ok so that's not to say every other game is perfect. red light, green light has the problem of bullets not being 100% fatal allowing for 2nd chances, other people being moved when half the game stampeded in retreat, the inconsistency of what considers ""movement"".another huge problem with the show is the subplot. the plot of the detective (i think he's a detective?) searching for his brother. not only did i just not care about this plot because we don't have much going for the detective character, but it's ending and setup is so flawed. why not check on the constantly suspicious looking guard earlier? why was he able to get away just because the doctor shouted? why did he waste his only bullet at the end? and not only that, the reveal that the front man was his brother, whilst not obvious, wasn't ""wow i did not see that coming"" either. in fact, after the reveal, the sub plot just ends. nothing comes out of knowing who the front man is. this whole subplot was just useless in the end, and only served a purpose so we know what's happening with the doctor. speaking of which, i get why he got shot in the end, but what if he was forced into helping the guards? why did the guards even try to kill him when they need him for their scheme? if they had to kill the doctor, why not the other players who got told about the game by the doctor himself? you could probably remove around 90% of this subplots content and you would have the same thing in the end. the detective doesn't achieve anything, we the audience don't obtain anything out of it besides from an attempt of a huge shocking reveal.despite my problems with the plot, the characters in this show are amazing. nearly all of the ones we spend time with are unique, interesting and dynamic. seong gi-hun is an incredibly executed character. being quite naive yet smart at times, he's more human than the characters he surrounds himself with, and yet overtime, his humanity starts to decrease, but it never breaks, even in the final game, he couldn't bring himself to kill his childhood friend, despite all that trauma, and even offered a withdrawal from the game. and yet, his emotions still cloud him. he's not perfect, he's a flawed individual. we see this so clearly at the start, when he finally wins ddakji and was about to slap the businessman, so eager for revenge, so into his anger at losing that he forgot what he was playing for. this was so beautifully mirrored in the last game, the squid game. at many moments, he had the chance to get victory, to walk into the circle. he didn't have to fight or kill his friend, he could have let the guards do it for him once he claimed victory, but because of his anger, he was too into it, he forgot what was on the line, and despite how in the first episode he was easily able to attempt the slap on the businessman, here he couldn't bring himself to kill him despite the fighting. it's so subtle yet that character development is huge. although he definitely does have plot armour. every single game, he won barely, always at the last second. even with the fight against his best friend, he was about to die but quickly turned the tables. i'm fine with this happening for the first 2 games or so, but every time? it gets old and repetitive.cho sang-woo is another incredibly written character from the start. he's cold. he's in this to win. and, opposite to gi-hun, his humanity actually breaks down as time goes on. sang-woo is, without a doubt, the smartest player in the game. he tries his best to increase his chances of winning, he tries his best to eliminate possible threats. he's the cause of the most emotional scene in the entire show. he looks the least likely to be someone like him, and yet it makes sense. you don't want to feel human in this game, you need strategy to increase the chances of survival, him being this character makes him the smartest, and yet, gi-hun can't accept it. ironically, gi-hun keeps calling him smart but when it comes down to his smartest thinking, gi-hun rejects it. he rejects the fact his childhood friend is like this. not only was their chemistry so natural, but when they had conflict, that also felt so realistic. my only problem is, i just don't feel like he's a real character himself. what i mean is, we know sang-woo isn't a psychopath, he does what he has to do to survive, but yet he shows no signs of remorse. no guilt. and it would have been better if at the start of the show, he wasn't already like this, making his change much more damaging.ok so sae-byeok is a pretty ok character. she has an interesting backstory, but the show just doesn't utilize her to the best they could. in episode 2, we had the chance to see the main characters and their lives, them realising it's much better to be in the games. and yet, we barely get any screen time with her. i understand at this point she wasn't a main character yet, but they could have at least done something to make her feel more complete. and then with the marble game, we see glimpses of sadness from her after killing that one irrelevant female character, and yet, that wasn't touched upon either. and for the most irritating thing, her death. ye her death is dumb. well not all of it. i like the fact sang-woo finishes her off, but the fact the glass even exploded in the first place is just a problem. i thought everyone was supposed to have an equal chance, front man? i guess not. felt like a cheap way to write in her death so the 2 childhood friends can have a 1v1 i guess.the other characters are great too, but unfortunately i don't have room to explain here sadly. ji-yeong and jun-ho are still irrelevant characters, deok-su's death feels so out of place also, and the final twist at the end of the show is dumb.also one thing that triggers me a lot about this show is the use of slow mos. stop!"

allowing 2nd chances, people moved half game stampeded retreat, inconsistency considers ""movement"".another huge problem show subplot. plot detective (i think he's detective?) searching brother. care

obvious, ""wow see coming"" either. fact, reveal, sub plot ends. nothing comes knowing front man is. whole subplot useless end, served purpose know what's happening doctor. speaking which, get got

and, opposite gi-hun, humanity actually breaks time goes on. sang-woo is, without doubt, smartest player game. tries best increase chances winning, tries best eliminate possible threats. he's cause emotional scene entire show. looks least likely someone like him, yet makes sense. want feel human game, need strategy increase chances survival, character makes smartest, yet, gi-hun can't accept it. ironically, gi-hun keeps calling smart comes smartest thinking, gi-hun rejects it. rejects fact childhood friend like this. chemistry natural, conflict, also felt realistic. problem is, feel like he's

(you don't have to own 20 marbles to win, the rule was just to win the marbles of your partner).in the last episode 001 says it was boring to watch these game he just wanted to play it - but there were documents from 1998 so he was bored for 20+ years? interesting from a genius.i won't rewatch the series, but if there will be a second season, i'm in."

1008	7	prettytwitches	Phenomenal start...	squid game tells an intriguing story and is very compelling. it is somewhat disturbing, brutal and fantastical in its storytelling of the class divide in society. nevertheless, once you start watching you won't be able to stop. most of the episodes are fantastic and really draw you into the story. the character development and story arcs are pretty solid, and the acting is phenomenal. i was also blown away by the set design, costumes and overall aesthetic. however, there is some plot points that i was not overly fond of. one being the whole organ harvesting side story. i understand that this was here to highlight there was an intruder amongst them but for me it just distracted from the story and overall aesthetic of the show. another was the 'twist' that il nam was behind the whole thing. i could see this a mile off but hoped that because the show had been clever so far it wouldn't fall into this trap. i was left feeling a bit deflated by the scene with him and seong gi-hun at the end. there are also some plot holes that are somewhat frustrating. like how was il nam phoning the front man to check in. especially when some of the other contestants were staying awake all night. also, when the front man goes to check out the washed-up body and finds his brother's badge. wouldn't he have known that the body was not his brother? still he goes back to the island like the issue had been handled. i do think that the show could have benefitted from maybe being 10 episodes as the last three feel somewhat rushed and different tonally from the rest of the show. i am also slightly frustrated that we did not find out more about the front man, this side of the story is somewhat lacking. i know a lot of people have taken issue with the vips acting. however, this did not bother me as it just added to the obnoxious and disgusting personality of these characters. finally, you will be mystified by seong gi-hun's hairstyle choice at the end, but i believe it is him trying 'start fresh' or trying to take back control of himself after what happened. kind of like when people get crazy hairstyles after a bad breakup. you will definitely be frustrated by sae-byoek's death but again for me it just highlighted that none of the characters, no matter how badass, were in control of what was going to happen. lastly, you may be annoyed by seong gi-hun's final decision to not get on the plane. however, i think this is showing that he is no longer going to just sit by and watch bad things happen to other people. this is a narrative of his character throughout. we know that he has ptsd from the riots during the protest at his work. where he sat by and watched someone get killed and again with the drunk guy on the street in the final episode. he could have gone down and helped the guy, but he didn't or maybe the show is just saying that people don't change. seong gi-hun is impulsive. whatever the reason it is a great segway for the next season.	squid game tells intriguing story compelling. somewhat disturbing, brutal fantastical storytelling class divide society. nevertheless, start watching

1020	7	drkne	Good, but not one of the best death game stories. How'd it get so popular?	i've loved death game stories ever since i started reading the gantz manga back in the early 2000's. or maybe i watched battle royale before that... not sure.i'm something of a gore hound, and enjoy the mixing and intersecting of various character arcs in these extreme situations. seeing many hit both their bests and their worsts in a short period of time. some have redemption arcs, some fall from grace and end in shame. it's almost always a fun rollercoaster of emotions.personally i'd rank this somewhere around the middle of the list for this particular niche genre. i don't quite understand how this one in particular became so popular. i guess that a lot of young people think this is a new concept.as with most visual media i've seen come out of korea, this has superb cinematography but imo, it falls short a bit in the writing and acting. i vastly prefer the similar japanese incarnations that stretch all the way to the unflinching, insane (sometimes hoaky) extremes that really embed them in your memory.i didn't like most of the cast and only found 2 characters somewhat likeable, with the rest ranging from vaguely annoying to insufferably annoying. i didn't really find any of them actually relatable.plus, who's idea was it to cover the face of the most famous (imo hottest) actor they have almost the whole time?!

1038	7	ermkaybruv	The first six episodes are gold, and then the glass shatters underneath it	"this show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. the characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. there were moments that made me cry, which i wasn't expecting. there was a point around the middle of the season where i was ready to call this the best tv show of the decade.and then the vips came in.their acting was atrocious, like the-room-level bad. i was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. my only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in american dialogue. not only did the vips break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.however, this didn't destroy the show for me, and i could have overlooked it. but then the show just sort of fell apart logically. first there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where i was just wondering throughout the entire thing: why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?and finally, sae-byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. what was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? it angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. and maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but i feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. it's almost like the show said, ""yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between seong gi-hun and mr. i'm-completely-selfish-until-the-plot-demands-i-sacrifice-myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover vip the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and seong gi-hun); and then seong gi hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the vips or something.i wouldn't have minded sae-byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. i wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. it's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.i still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and i can't overstate that. i sat back in awe many times and said, ""this is one of the best scenes in tv history."" i will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. there was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that i felt bored or disinterested. i feel like this show raises the bar for netflix and i'm glad i watched it.i just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. if it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. and it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end."

The rest weren't	"the first 6 episodes had me questioning whether this show was a masterpiece and one of netflix's best pieces. everything from the acting to the cinematography to the writing was incredible and really dragged u into this world in which there was no escape. and then i watched episode 7. the vips were awful and served no purpose to the story what so ever and seemed like a waste of time with cringe humour and simply bad acting. the episode 7 game was also taken straight from ""kaiji"" an anime. they attempted to cram so many plot twits and turns to the point where it wore down the finale so much it was boring to watch. the main plot twist was incredibly predictable and honestly if it had a simpler ending it would be an easy 10/10 and one of the best netflix shows they've put out ever. i do recommend it but by the end you don't really care about the lead character and it just feels odd (not in a good way). this show was so close to being an absolute bombardment of genius tv show making but the last few episodes took that title away. all in all a solid show but just a bad ending. it doesn't ruin the show it's just annoying to see such a brilliant show take such an awful ending."

1083	9	wcddg	Really great show with a few minor hiccups..	"i loved the show and binged it through in one night. great acting of the main characters. so all in all a great show, that was very emotional at times and had me on the edge of my seat. the show plays with a lot of moral dilemmas as well as drawing a critical portrait of the structural injustices of late capitalism, as well as the arrogance and misanthrophy of the super rich.only a couple things in the plot were a bit sloppy / confusing:1) the cop - he manages to get in there and move around unseen for that long with cameras everywhere? when he's alone with the vip and leaves him unconscious and naked - how on earth does that not bother / alarm the other vips? shouldn't they be up in arms? and then his missing brother is actually working as a sort of head operator for the game despite only being missing for a short while? why does the brother shoot him dead off that cliff, literal seconds after telling him he wouldn't do that and after telling his men to bring him in alive? seemed so pointless. so many questionmarks and i feel there was room to play it out differently.2) the way the players behaved during the game. it was abundantly clear that this was a ""winner takes it all"" scenario, meaning only one would get out alive and win the prize. what on earth was going on with all the bonding and trying to ""get out together""? and then in the next moment they were all over each other killing each other with their bare hands over some missed food rations. it did add to the drama and definitely worked for the character development, but this seemed a bit random.3) the vote / return to the game. when they first voted to end the game, the old guy actually decided the vote with his vote. why on earth would he do that. just to motivate the players by going back to their old lives, to come back on their own accord? seems an awful lot of extra risk and effort, having all these people back in the real world after the atrocities they have just witnessed. also he had shared with the other players that he had a brain tumor and was dying, it would have made all the sense in the world, had he chosen to continue.then they said: we will split the money among the families of the deceased. when the players returned, the money was still there.3) the vips poor / clichée acting and demeanor. maybe it was actually intended, as the whole show is a parable for the injustices of late capitalism, which then again, apparently went over so many heads that it's not even funny anymore. ""they were there voluntarily, right?"" ""see what bad choices lead to?"" - no, it's a structural problem that made these people so desperate that a life and death murder game seemed like the more viable option than trying their best in the free world. how anyone can see that as their own fault and not see how the system is designed to exploit the vast majority of people into debt slavery while the 1% are so bored they literally start killing people for fun - well that is entirely beyond me. i wish more people would understand this not-so-subtle subtext of the show.4) the prize. i was actually surprised the winner even got the prize money in the end (and apparently there are no tax authorities in south korea) and they let him go, knowing what he knows. but even more surprising: did the main character not have 4 million debt with some gangsters who were out for his blood? how could he have ""gone back to his old life"" in his neighbourhood for a full year - and not have touched the prize money - without at least paying off his debt?still loved it."

1084	8	mayaajey	It was really good!	it was a very good series, i really enjoyed it! i do like this type of genre so i was looking forward to watch it! i think that the plot was entertaining and i also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as money heist (the guys wearing red suits) or star wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like darth vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which i didn't mind. i also noticed that the series is pretty similar to hunger games and alice in borderland on different aspects but i still find it unique and interesting. i didn't mind the vip acting tbh, i've seen worse and that was ok. however there is one thing that i would have changed. i would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and i guess more 'bossy'. idk but i felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. i remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? it just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. that's my opinion tho, it's not that big of a deal. the rest was good!again i liked the plot, i liked the characters and the writing was good. yes there are things that i didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? just like that?? what was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? and there is morehowever i did enjoy the series and i can't wait for the next season.	good series, really enjoyed it! like type genre looking forward watch it! think plot entertaining also think series took inspiration different popular series money heist (the guys wearing red suits) star wars (the guy wearing black mask looked like darth vader) even typical play station logo basic geometric shape, mind. also noticed series pretty similar hunger games alice borderland different aspects still find unique interesting. mind vip acting tbh, i've seen worse ok. however one thing would changed. would made evil guys red suits stronger guess 'bossy'. idk felt like scenes red suits guys really strong able manage participant properly. remember one scene red guy take mask order handle situation participant (knowing so, might die!?) red suits guys trained well enough job not?

1085	8	ba-80642	Finale kinda ruined it for me	up to episode 6 this show was near perfect, every aspect of it was extremely enjoyable, the pacing kept you hooked while not making everything feel unnatural, the acting was realistic and everyone really stayed true to their character, the filming was really enjoyable and it gave you a great way to see stuff, then with episode 7, they introduced american vips, now don't get me wrong they definitely didn't have good acting, but i will give them credit for really being emotionless and portraying what kind of people they are supposed to be, plus they didn't take much from the plot so i didn't care too much for them, and finally the 5th game on the 7th episode was arguably my favorite, so i enjoyed that too, episode 8 wasn't bad in terms of anything but plotting, you follow up with the cop the entire show just for him to be killed by his brother who is for some reason the front man who also won the game a few years back, it really doesn't make sense, doesn't add to the show, and doesn't have a backstory to rest on, but again that's kind of a side story which shouldn't interfere with the main story and the main character's story, so the finale must be great? right? not really, the finale starts off okay with the final game but the writing feels extremely off, everyone breaks character, there isn't much story progression, and the worst thing, the old man is behind it all, for some reason the old man (001) is the one who started and made the game because he was too rich, this would've been an okay story if he didn't take part in the game and have his character built off being a poor old man risking it all, because he wouldn't actually die, we also see the main character ( assumably ) try to seek revenge instead of going to get custody of his daughter, which's a major way for netflix to milk the show by leaving it on a cliffhanger and probably making a second season, i hope they can find a way to make the second season somehow good, but there isn't much to do, he'll just, seek revenge? then it's over, nothing else to do, other than get his life back in order, which should've been part of the finale, however i have to give credit to this show for consistently having great acting and filming, which's why i think it deserves an 8 regardless of the abysmal choices they took after episode 6.	episode 6 show near perfect, every aspect extremely enjoyable, pacing kept hooked making everything feel unnatural, acting realistic everyone really stayed true character, filming really enjoyable gave great way see stuff, episode 7, introduced american vips, get wrong definitely good acting, give credit really emotionless portraying kind people supposed be, plus take much plot care much them, finally 5th game 7th episode arguably favorite, enjoyed too, episode 8 bad terms anything plotting, follow cop entire show killed brother reason front man also game years back, really make sense, add show, backstory rest on, that's kind side story interfere main story main character's story, finale must great?

Never a dull moment	this show is so well made. from a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. the lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!the idea is great! most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. there were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of squid game was fantastic. the entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience why these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.i imagine there is, as always, some errors with korean to english translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.it felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.highly recommended.	show well made. technical standpoint, shot beautifully way differentiate completely shows similar tones. lighting, sets, costumes, locations, fantastic!the idea great! things made sense story-wise character-wise. moments questionable came character decisions easy look past majority squid game fantastic. entire second episode pretty much dedicated really making clear audience characters would subject game done way believable.i imagine is, always, errors korean english translation dialogue (in subtitle form) incredibly nose structured way people simply talk way again, easy look past show interesting throughout enjoyable.it felt like 9/10 hour movie, rather series episode flows seamlessly next carries momentum, especially binge watching.highly recommended.	show well made  technical standpoint  shot beautifully way differentiate completely shows similar tones  lighting  sets  costumes  locations  fantastic the idea great  things made sense story wise character wise  moments questionable came character decisions easy look past majority squid game fantastic  entire second episode pretty much dedicated really making clear audience characters would subject game done way believable i imagine is  always  errors korean english translation dialogue  in subtitle form  incredibly nose structured way people simply talk way again  easy look past show interesting throughout enjoyable it felt like 9 10 hour movie  rather series episode flows seamlessly next carries momentum  especially binge watching highly recommended 	['show', 'well', 'made', 'technic', 'standpoint', 'shot', 'beauti', 'way', 'differenti', 'complet', 'show', 'similar', 'tone', 'light', 'set', 'costum', 'locat', 'fantast', 'idea', 'great', 'thing', 'made', 'sens', 'stori', 'wise', 'charact', 'wise', 'moment', 'question', 'came', 'charact', 'decis', 'easi', 'look', 'past', 'major', 'squid', 'game', 'fantast', 'entir', 'second', 'episod', 'pretti', 'much', 'dedic', 'realli', 'make', 'clear', 'audienc', 'charact', 'would', 'subject', 'game', 'done', 'way', 'believ', 'imagin', 'alway', 'error', 'korean', 'english', 'translat', 'dialogu', 'subtitl', 'form', 'incred', 'nose', 'structur', 'way', 'peopl', 'simpli', 'talk', 'way', 'easi', 'look', 'past', 'show', 'interest', 'throughout', 'enjoy', 'felt', 'like', '9', '10', 'hour', 'movi', 'rather', 'seri', 'episod', 'flow', 'seamlessli', 'next', 'carri', 'momentum', 'especi', 'bing', 'watch', 'highli', 'recommend']

gotten another 160. so you see, gambling isn't good😂. anyways the main theme of this show is in korea people struggle. and everyone's life's suck ass.the show follows this guy who just won big in horse racing and gets picked pocketed and loan sharks come after him and then meets a stalker business man. they play ddakji. this a game where you have to flip the paper on the ground, and the main character loses and in exchanged gets slapped to lose 100,000 wons from the debt count. and so he walks away with 200,000 wons. and so he returns home and his mom is upset because he looks brutally beaten up. anyways he has the card from the business man and goes to where he'll be picked up and enter the game: squid game duh duh duh. also he's number 456. and so he learns they're gonna play the worse twisted saw like games that are children games basically- red light/green light, honey comb cutting out the cookie, marbles, tug of war, squid game and hop starch(on glass bridge). the show is so detailed and has so many good ideas that i really over look the cliques, the plot armor and plot conveniences. the twist i have to say i saw coming because it's obvious, as i watch so many movies i saw many things coming. and i love the music score, the best i've heard in a while. the editing so top notch, the violence is not that bad, everyone complaining hasn't watched saw. this is funny and it's not in bad spirit tbh, like it has meaning. and the acting of you go from english over the korean actors to subtitles is pretty good. i like how unique this show is even tho i've seen hunger games and battle royal and saw. this is the best out of them, the child games they play is hilarious and i love it all, i didn't see what was coming but i wanted tag or red rover or spear the queer lmao. but this show is so heart warming so energized and so horror i like it a lot. i'll give it a b+, the only bad thing is sometimes some of the subplots are nonsense and the cop is annoying, and the vips suck ass. but beside that i love this show. watch it!!!	gambling, bad, try bet much decide pick green bay 50 chiefs 50 get 130 back green bay loss... could've gotten another 160. see,

1179	8	eagle_eyes2	Show Adds Morals and Is Captivating	i watched this show in the original language of korean with english subtitles.i'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. one big thing i like in shows is morality. everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. i enjoy star trek because of the focus on morals. same thing with the orville. this show is no exception.one important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. this is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.spoilers: the first game involved a deadly game of red light, green light. unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. the creators used technology to detect movement. upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.what got the players to come was potential prize money. each eliminated player added money to the pot.after the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. they barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.however, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. the game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.i don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. my thinking changed during the course of the show.while watching the first game, i'm thinking that i would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so i wouldn't die. i'm hoping i wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.for the second game, i don't know if i would have passed. i might be too scared to try, or i would be too careful and run out of time. each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.for the third game and even during the riot, i didn't think about what i would do in their situation. i probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.for game four, this opens so many possibilities. would i sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would i sincerely try to beat the other? what game would i choose? of course, it would depend on who my partner was. also, would i to trick the other, so i would survive and move on? i probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.one character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. he wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. one character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. i was thinking along those lines, too.for game five, the first thing i would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. one of the later players ended up doing that. the host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. it was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. there was a time limit involved. when one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, i got the feeling that the player behind should push him.in summary, this show got my attention and my interest. i was even cheering for some of the characters, and i disliked a couple. the morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. the show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.	watched show original language korean english subtitles.i'm writing review

1224	5	justinpengahs	VERY GOOD SHOW UNTIL EPISODE 7	i was very much enjoying this show and one of my favourite characters is sae-byeok. her scene with ji-yeong who gave up her marbles for her in episode 6 was by far the most emotional scene for me. throughout the show, she was portrayed as a cold and emotionless girl, right up until that scene when she finally broke.even though i loved her character, i already knew she wasn't going to make it till the end. but a character like her deserves an impactful ending and that was all i wanted for her. however, the way she got injured and eventually died was total bs for me.before you come at me by saying that i'm too emotionally invested, read what i have to say next.in episode 7, the remaining players go through a bridge of glass. they choose between 2 types of glasses to step on: regular glass and tempered glass. many of them made missteps and fell and the glass broke. towards the end of the episode, we were left with 3. when the game ended, the glass bridge shatters and sae-byeok gets stabbed with a shard.if you playback at the scene where the glass shatters, you'll see the huge error made where the glass that should have already been shattered by the players were shattered again. this huge error caused me to lose all immersion in the show.furthermore, up till this point, all injuries to players were made by other players. their policy was that all players should be given equal chance to succeed. so what was the point in shattering the bridge and injuring the players?episode 7 had some poor decision making in terms of writing and visuals. from then on, it was hard for me to enjoy the last 2 episodes.	much enjoying show one favourite characters sae-byeok. scene ji-yeong gave marbles episode 6 far emotional

1241	7	degonyte	An entertaining and addictive series with an occasionally shallow plot	squid game is absolutely worth the watch. it is fascinating, exciting and at times moving. the first and currently only season is highly suited for a proper binging session, as the conclusion of each episode will leave you wondering what will happen next, and where all of this will ultimately go. sadly, the pay-off is not as grand as we are led to believe.the visual presentation of squid game is wonderfully surreal. endless staircases, pastel colors and trick doors make the entrance to the game area seem like a demented funhouse designed by m. c. escher. the facility is guarded by ominous masked figures in bright pink jumpsuits, and the game areas themselves are nightmarish visions of children's playgrounds. this gives the entire series an uncanny, oppressive atmosphere throughout all nine episodes. in terms of set design, costume design and overall visual presentation, squid game could not have done much better.however, the narrative that unfolds against this otherworldly backdrop is not always as coherent or fleshed-out as the perfectly composed environments would suggest.squid game is a variation of the concept of a 'death game', which has been seen many times before in productions such as running man and hunger games.series director and writer hwang dong-hyuk adds variation to this familiar concept by emphasizing the voluntary nature of the game: each contestant has to apply themselves in order to join the game, and even after they have been sedated and kidnapped to the island where the games are to take place, they are given ample opportunity to leave and return to their normal lives.the game rules even include the option to halt the games at any time, should a majority of the contestants vote to do so. in episode 2, this is exactly what ends up happening. the episode then goes on to try and establish that, despite the horrors of these murderous children's games, the normal lives of the participants are so dire and hopeless that they cannot but conclude that game is the lesser of two evils, and by the end of the episode, 93% of the original surviving players have returned to continue the game. this is an impossible idea to sell to an audience, even when the pool of contestants is supposed to consist of the country's most desperate and indebted.fantastical premise aside, the way the actual games play out will leave you with sweaty palms more than once. in addition to its presentation, another strong point of the series is feeding us information and letting us try and puzzle it together before feeding us answers. the behavior and motivation of certain characters and even major plot points can be figured out well in advance if you know what to look for and how to piece it all together. this adds an extra layer of tension to the already nerve-wrecking death games.although the series eventually goes out of its way to answer some of the most pressing questions, there is occasional room for speculation. was sang woo a humble man who got corrupted by his desperation to win the game, only to find back his humanity at the very end? or was he a cold and calculating cutthroat who was planning to abuse the trust of others from the get-go, ultimately taking his own life simply because he refused to go back to his miserable life?squid game could have benefitted from leaving more of such questions open to the interpretation of the viewer. the most glaring example of this is the mystery surrounding the vips who view and fund these games, which was decisively shattered by the absolutely horrid actors who played them, clumsily delivering dialogue so juvenile that you couldn't get away with it in a call of duty voice lobby.similarly, the big reveal at the end, that the old man was the mastermind behind it all, might have been best left to fan speculation. not only does this scooby doo-like villain reveal feel cheap, predictable and too on-the-nose, but when the character is asked about his motivation for the game, the answer reveals how downright shallow the plot can be on occasions. the old man, who is on his deathbed, reveals that the game was put together to provide excitement to himself and his exorbitantly rich friends. perverted elites paying to see poor, desperate people die for their own twisted entertainment was my first guess upon learning the show's premise, and it was truly disappointing to see that my surface-level observation proved to be all there was to it.that all being said, most of the acting, pacing and visualization of squid game do carry the series to great heights. when it's good, it really is good. particular praise has to go to hoyeon jung. in what is reportedly her major acting debut, she excellently portrays kang sae-byeok, who is perhaps one of the only truly likeable characters playing the game, as she is one of the few contestants not stupid, a backstabber or both. the north korean defector, who hopes to win the money to help her mother, who still lives in her home country, and her orphaned brother. sae-byeok wears her cold, almost ruthless disposition as her armor, but ultimately shows more humanity than most of the other contestants, even breaking down completely when her opponent in the marble game throws the match to guarantee sae-byeok's survival. these shifts in her personality, both sudden and gradual, are given immense weight by the actress's performance, and it's in moments like these that the series truly shines.there can be little doubt that squid game is an entertaining, addictive watch. ultimately though, its inconsistency does end up harming it. the series might hit a home run in one area, but then completely drop the ball in the next. as a viewer, you are left wondering where it all goes, trusting that all these plot points which the creators dangle in front of you will ultimately pay off. in the end, the series is like the giant piggy bank full of money that perpetually hovers over the contestants' heads in the sleeping area. after the violence is over and the dust settles, you get what you expected, but you're still left with a feeling of emptiness.	squid game absolutely worth watch. fascinating, exciting times moving. first currently season highly suited proper binging session, conclusion episode leave wondering

my score. more specifically the lack of. the main questions that should be answered do get answered, but the many many subplots remain unsolved. for example the whole police character and doctor storyline, completely half-assed finish, unsatisfying. also many many continuity issues. the whole everyone here is equal rule gets broken on the side of its creator every single episode, and there also a lot of shot-to-shot continuity issues which the editor didn't seem to catch, but they are noticeable (like the knife in ep8, a main factor and a huge story element whichh we're ment to keep the focus on but somehow it manages to do a cartwheel in seong's pocket while being in the center frame). the show is great and definitely deserves a watch, i do still think however that they needed to map out the ending storylines slightly better for tall the secondary characters. i'm not going to waste time talking about the vips. yes they suck and shouldn't be in the show, served almosy no purpose. i wish they were more influtual and coused a rift between the creators because they broke the eqality rule or something. they remain badly executed and any point to them was rendered

1360	8	xrpredbull	a story about trust and relationship	"there are three types of human relationships that squid game characters have.type 1. the relationship between deoksu (101) and his gang to obey by power.type 2. human relationships (218 and 1), such as sang-woo (218), il-nam (1), that give others to benefit from human relationships (218 and 1) succeeded in society, are intelligent, and elite)type 3. ki hoon (456), abdul ali (199), sae byuk (67) and ji young (240) have pure trust (less social experience or unemployed)the best way to relate was to play the 4th game.a. saebyuk-jiyoung, deoksu-his subordinates were a team of the same type.saebyuk and jiyoung lived a difficult life as north korean defectors and killers in society, but jiyoung sacrifices for the saebyuk that opened her hand for the first time (confrontation between type 3)deoksu and his subordinates usually work together, but they have no choice but to turn right away in extreme situations where they live only when they kill each other (confrontation between type 1)deoksu's betrayal by his subordinates before entering the squid game immediately shows how easy human relationships are to be betrayed in extreme situations.b. abdul ali-sangwoo, ilnam-kihoon were a team of different types of people.in the confrontation between abdul ali (199) and sangwoo (218), abdul ali trusts sangwoo until the end, but sangwoo betrays and wins (type 2 wins against type 3).sang-woo (218) gives ali abdul a bus fare, but i think he has changed in the same way as type 2 as he has experienced a loss if he acts like 199 while adapting to society.-ilnam (1) and kihoon (456) are people who have lived opposite lives even in their numbers.il-nam (no. 1) meets and plays with people like ki-hoon (no. 456), who already makes a lot of money and feels demonstrated in life as he grows old, and gives no return, and feels joy in pure human relationships.ki-hoon (456) gives a favor to il-nam (1) and impresses the writing so that il-nam loses on purpose (type 3 wins type 2)ilnam (1) is a successful person in life, and he has lived in type 2 way, and he seemed to think that it was right.social life, socially high command and a lot of income people who think we should act in ways such as type 1 or type 2.i think i've experienced that type of people win while playing squid for a long time.the scene that shows this appears in the scene where vip bet 101 or 218 times as a favorite.ki hoon (456) was a person who overturned all of the above thoughts.-vip didn't pick kihoon (456) as the favorite.in the final, when ki-hoon (456) tried to give up the money without stabbing him, sang-woo was moved by ki-hoon and committed suicide by admitting that his beliefs lost to ki-hoon.ilnam(1) has lost his mindset while playing the game.he lost to the type of person he thought was stupid who had stepped on to get a high position throughout his life.the last time ilnam called ki-hoon to play the game in the last episode seems to have tried to discuss ki-hoon's reversal of his thoughts for the last time.kihoon (456) met ilnam at the end and played a game, and asked ilnam, ""i won now, right?""while playing the squid game, ki-hoon showed ilnam that his thoughts were wrong as a result, but ki-hoon doesn't seem to know that he did.it was a series that allowed people to reconsider human relationships by showing that people like ki hoon, who give trust and favor in no return, beat others."

1368	8	spiroubarcelona	The squid financial game	"although i don't usually like violent weird fictional series i would like to comment on this one, which i found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and i would like to give some hints of why i think this. there may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.in the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.the gamethe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. and this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. but the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.the island, the leader and the policemanthe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. this is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.the secondary playersbetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. there is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...the old man and the main characterfinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. the first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other vips, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. his reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. the last one is all of us, is the tv watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. this is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. and then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. he can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. however, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. he and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. so, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore."

"this one kept me watching. great characters. interesting, if very dark story. i didn't find myself rooting for any single person. they were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term i use very loosely here. he's not likeable. he leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. again, he wasn't likeable. but he was a well written character who at times i almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.there is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.not every story needs a good guy though. i am fine with this. in fact, i applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.in several ways, this series reminded me of alice in borderland, which i personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.cue forward to the vip scenes. as mentioned before, that could have been done much better. i don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.i can handle the occasional bad actor. i honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these vips filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. especially the old man with his 69 obsession. his lines were bad, his delivery, worse. whoever he is, i hope that was the last time i saw him on a screen. he wouldn't have been out of place in troll 2.i want to end this on a positive note. honestly, the story was really good. the plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one i personally didn't expect, even if i had some suspicions. towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone i can almost respect. which is quite an accomplishment on its own.but he should have gotten on the plane."

1379	7	mrloetter	Fun with some disappointing bits (SPOILERS)	"it was fun, but the show falls back on usual korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the vips was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.examples (spoilers!)1. the players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. it's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. no one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. they all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. they tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. really dumb!3. the first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. when they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. the missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. they gave my fav character a super cheap death. cmon, random exploding glass took her out? she's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? how did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? it was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. they took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. the main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. the whole ending after that was very forced.7. the red hair thing was a little stupid. as was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. in the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. when he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. again.9. they didn't tie off a few things. the morse code thing went nowhere if i'm not mistaken. the guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from n korea.10. also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is amazing. no way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. even mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? they say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. no way they'd know that would happen. and it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. it's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).and that's about what i remember. it was fun, but a little stupid too. it started very strong and could have been great, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes."

1445	9	Acalyn	A thought-provoking, fast-paced drama with everything to offer	"squid game is one of the most popular tv series of 2021 so i decided i would try it out. the show completely captured me when it came to the drama between the characters and the intensity of the games. i recommend this show if you're interested in a fast-paced, drama series that will leave you on the edge of your seat and will make you think at the same time. this show is relentless and graphic so it's not for the faint of heart. for nine episodes, hwang dong-hyuk captured many facets of humanity and the world as we know it.characters:i enjoyed many of the characters and the acting was phenomenal. at first i criticized gi-hun for being a gambler but as the series went on it showed his tragic downfall and the lack of job security in south korea. i don't know much about south korea but i imagined it to be somewhat more prosperous than america. no, everywhere is cruel, i learned, as the world showed ali's kindness taken advantage of and the ending bet with the man in the snow. i loved sae-byeok and i cried when her friend gave up her life for her. i even felt some remorse for player 218, or sangwoo, when he was lying in the rain, completely jaded, the rain crashing down on him on the realization on what he did. each character has their moment and i felt for each one of them.**themes:the themes are what make this show beautiful. gi-hun and sang-woo being foils of each others was well-executed. i kept asking myself the question, is sang-woo wrong? he had to kill those people to survive. he had to push the man in glass hopskotch or the others wouldn't have made it. he did what he had to do to survive, and yet we critcize him because we think it's what we wouldn't have done. but we would we to survive? and then the war of poverty and tragedy with all the characters was honest but heart-breaking to see. ali still had to break his morals and hurt a man to receive his salary for his family. 067 or sae-byeok pickpocketed because she had nothing else to resort to - after all, she was an illegal alien from north korea. we don't know why sang-woo fought (he had only his mother left) but he wanted to restore himself instead of admit he was not the pride of his hometown.**criticismsmany plot threads go nowhere. doctor sub-plot was pointless, although i was still chilled by the front-man's lack of respect for the player's body. also, the morse code wasn't mentioned again unless it was relevant to the doctor subplot.jun-ho effortlessly managing to get into squid island. would have been interesting if they had intentionally let him raid it and kill him afterward (after all, who can be blamed if everyone remains anon. this man broke the rules so many times but the most he got was a slap on the wrist? what is the point of the rules for the employees then if the only enforced rules are the masks?the plot twist with jun-ho finding out the front man was his brother. an extreme plot hole considering the beginning (mentioned by mrloletter) when jun-ho was paying his brother's rent for only a month. his brother wasn't missing that long. but then later we find out that he won in 2015(?), so 5 years before the show began. so i guess the brother is a bit older than him but holy crap the front man looks considerably older. i didn't really understand the plot twist. maybe the front-man will feel bad that he killed his brother? it showed that he did feel some remorse and that he was willing to save his brother. since we don't understand the front man's motivations this scene was very odd.the vips. the acting was horrible and ruined my immersion in the show.the endingpersonally i really loved the ending. many don't like how gi-hun turns into a strawberry but i liked the symbolism, albeit it was way too obvious. he had lost his mother, explaning why he didn't go straight to his daughter. even though he had won he still felt like he had failed. that he was too late. the worst feeling in the world. he felt like he was a horrible person and didn't know what to say to his daughter (remember that he still hit her stepfather and never explained it to her). even with him calling the number and saying that ""i'm a threat"" was a bit interesting since it leads on to a season 2, and also shows he still has some fight left in him.player one being the founder was an odd twist but i still liked it since it exposed who he was as a person and his attitudes toward the poor (being deserving). playet one was honest at the games telling gi-hun, his gganbu, his reasons, his motivations, and even his greatest weaknesses. he still loved gi-hun in some way that i still liked his character (even though he's a horrible person).overall i'm excited for season 2 and what to come. squid game is absolutely amazing!"

1481	5	guruism-69711	Just another mediocre show..Not worth the hype at all	first of all, i can't understand why does this show have 8.3 imbd rating. i am assuming that the audience who have reviewed it are mostly those who haven't watched many series / movies of this genre.all in all it's s just another series with some psychopath killing every person who is not able to win / survive a game but with a mix of emotions and drama. if you are thinking that this is a series filled with thrilling chilling moments at every step, you are mistaken. the first episode made me think that this could be a bit different but by the third episode i was wondering why am i even watching it. every now and then, there will be useless drama, emotional dialogues explaining why each character is playing this game, what their monetary problems are and why they want to get the prize money at any cost. many useless dialogues and excessive emotional drama that do not make any sense in this kind of series. side plot stories that lead to nowhere in the end. lead character is dumb and remains dumb till the end. acting by the cast is okayish but it deteriorates drastically by the last two episodes. this series is not worth your time. if you like watching psychological thrillers where people get massacred then there are many way better than this like the collection, saw series, get out(2017), final destination series etc.but if you want to watch it anyways because of the hype or because of your interest in what the hell these games are, skip to the following timestamps for these episodes and you will be satisfied -episode 1: full episodeepisode 2: ignore. everyone is just a cry baby. no games in this one.episode 3: after 28:00episode 4: after 39:58episode 5: till 02:20, no games in this one. just a dumb side story.episode 6: start at 14:56. this is the most boring one and unfortunately the game takes up the whole episode. watch this at 1.5x speed.episode 7: after 17:57, this has a little

1511	7	enigmafantasy	Grazing the majesty	it's obvious that the idea of the games involving the lives of humans has appeared more than once in tv shows. although the director has confirmed that the idea was planned many years ago, it's questionable that originality is one of its strengths. however, this series has made a different approach to the category, and for that reason i can understand its impact.the mixture of show and survival makes this story special. involving emotions in tragic games transforms fear into treason, empathy into selfishness and hate into pain. something that is usually complex to achieve. social context plays an essential role in the series. knowing the personal situations of the participants creates a vital link between the game and society. best aspects? feelings. everything that this series could make you feel has a purpose and a reason. almost every action of the characters is explainable in a certain way but also leaves you room for doubts and predictions about the next move. you won't get bored with the episodes, which is a priority among thrillers.drawbacks? as i see it, the games ended faster than i was expecting. when you are risking your life, time seems to pass really slowly and in the series it happened all the opposite. for instance, i would have tried to enlarge the game scenes in the episodes. it's true that with this improvement your are risking the total timing, and perhaps it could become tiring, but that would be the best idea to take advantage of such a great plot. it would also have given the chance to extend a bit on the story of some characters that are relevant in the development of the series, which could be seen as one of the negative aspects, the lack of depth.all in all, it's such an excellent production, and i strongly recommend it without doubts.	obvious idea games involving lives humans appeared tv shows. although director confirmed idea planned many years ago, questionable originality one strengths. however, series made different approach category, reason understand impact.the mixture show survival makes story special. involving emotions tragic games transforms fear treason, empathy selfishness hate pain. something usually complex achieve. social context plays essential role series. knowing personal situations participants creates vital link game society. best aspects?

1639	8	stephenmacky	A hell of a rollercoaster ride	since i've recently finished the current season of the show, i thought i'd share my views here. i'd like to start off by saying that the show started off on a good note. i started watching it like pretty much everyone else, it created a lot of buzz on the internet, so i thought it must be worth checking out. the concept of the show was itself good and for the most part, well executed. it took me back, since when i first started watching the show, i didn't know what to expect. i felt like the show did generally well with the character development and the plot, despite the little time it had. my primary criticism is aimed towards the aftermath from episode 6 of the show. the show was really a hell of a rollercoaster ride till that point. like many others, i also disliked the portrayal of the vips. their portrayal was more of an annoyance and a disturbance than anything else. they had weird accents and pronunciation, cheesy lines and way of talking. they served more to distract than add something to the plot. the final boss fight between gi-hun and sang-woo could also have been performed better. sang-woo went down too easily. the detective's (presuming he survived) and his brother's storylines were left on a cliffhanger. then the ending is the current and trending problem of the show. it left too many unanswered questions and it'd be disappointing for the show to end on such a note. if there are plans for a 2nd season, then it will have a lot of explaining to do: the organization, how gi-hun was able to stay under the radar despite being filthy rich, the role of in-ho and etc.	since i've recently finished current season show, thought i'd share views here. i'd like start saying show started good note.
