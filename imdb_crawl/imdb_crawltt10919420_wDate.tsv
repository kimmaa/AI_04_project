10	9 October 2021	Leofwine_draca	A new TV classic	Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.
9	10 October 2021	kosmasp	Just a game	Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!
10	11 October 2021	Tweekums	Games to die for	This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.
5	9 October 2021	FeastMode	if you think this is good, PLEASE watch the korean movie Oldboy	I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.
7	8 October 2021	Irishchatter	It started off strong but ended disoriented	I honestly don't know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane. At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didn't do it for me chief....
8	4 October 2021	Edvis-1997	8	I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.
1	16 October 2021	John6Daniels	Number 6	I don't know what the criteria is to write a review for this garbage show.Squid game is a garbage show.The movie is about killing and abusing people.Some people are entertained by this show . For me I only lasted 20mins. If people are going to hype a show then the bar will be set quite high.For squid game though the bar must have been set low.Last Words: Squid Game is overrated.
0	3 October 2021	Top_Dawg_Critic	🦑🎮 Not close to perfect, but still amazing.	Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me.
10	12 October 2021	RosanaBotafogo	Perfect, Beautiful and lovely...	Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn't even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...Ep 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..Ep 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...I finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this...
8	14 October 2021	billcr12	Addicting	A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.
9	10 October 2021	alindsay-al	A Fantastic truly unique show	So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main CharacterLee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting CharactersThere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.StoryThe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.ScriptThe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.StyleThe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.OverallOverall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.
8	29 September 2021	andrewchristianjr	A TRUE SOCIAL COMMENTARY ON HUMANITY, COMPETITION, AND AVARICE.	I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the "kill game" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.
7	25 September 2021	ks-60500	Life is a game	Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.
10	24 September 2021	dwp1948	An Excellent New Korean Series Concept Viewers Enjoy - Highly Recommended	09/23/2021 The first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed, a more serious, ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues, even possible death? I found the series in the overall really great, refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded. I hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come? A great show from my perspective!
7	17 October 2021	Kingslaay	Ruthless and addictive	I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health.
8	6 October 2021	qui_j	Korean Soap Opera meets Hunger Games	This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses "Hunger Games" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of "actors" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!
9	6 October 2021	zhyarTheChosen	Woouuuughhhhh	I really loved this shot series best series of the uear no question asked but the ending kinda bad but overall fantastic.
8	14 October 2021	Xstal	The Court of Calamari...	A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.
10	4 October 2021	gianmarcoronconi	Beautiful	One of the most beautiful series I've ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed.
7	9 October 2021	MadamWarden	SQUITE GOOD	Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.Nothing really new in the plot. Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!
8	11 October 2021	gedikreverdi	Children's games have never been this exciting	I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10.
7	20 September 2021	surfisfun	first half decent, then it feel overstay.the games lost it appeals by 5th one	Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea.
8	17 October 2021	abisio	On the same path but not as good PARASITE and not as violent as it looks like	Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.The first 7 chapters is about the people's misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).
7	7 October 2021	Horror_Flick_Fanatic	Fun Horror Show	I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe.
8	23 September 2021	Movi3DO	Intense and entertaining thriller	Fly Me to the MoonLet me play among the starsLet me see what spring is like onA Jupiter and MarsIn other words, hold my handIn other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.
6	16 October 2021	0w0	Starts out amazing... then by EP05 it loses its all drive	So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of "we play fair games against each other, based on skill" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that.
7	9 October 2021	djurrepower	good	Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can't say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn't make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.7/10: good but not great.
8	8 October 2021	SoumikBanerjee25	The Writing Steals the Limelight here.	"You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on"Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?
8	23 September 2021	aboalhyjaa	For those who didn't understand **	For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching "that character is me!".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.
9	7 October 2021	bshaef	Overall, an excellent series	But there were some plot holes. The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out.Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade...But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah.
7	26 September 2021	chunkylefunga	Hidden Gem	A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made.
8	18 October 2021	garabedian123	The beginning is stupid but it gets better	When he finally wins some money...only to lose it 3 seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. But eventually I did and it is pretty good. Of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. Both twists were so predictable. The police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...Being rich is just awful...lol Korea must have lots of poor people.
7	2 October 2021	Dragonborn64	Good Though Certainly Not Original	I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There's a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?
8	26 September 2021	lareval	Great and addictive Netflix series	Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!
8	8 October 2021	AvionPrince16	Nice TV show with some great moments	Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.
10	26 September 2021	alcantaraj-16594	A BLOODY STORY THAT ISN'T FOR EVERYONE	"Squid Game" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore.
8	8 October 2021	paulwattriley	Different but the same	Its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins. Episode 6 was the best episode. If there's a season two it needs to be the revenge.
9	3 October 2021	PedroPires90	Well done	So intense, so well crafted, so many meanings, dramatic, sadistic, emotional...television doesn't get much better than this.
10	17 October 2021	BrnzReviews	I Loved Squid Game!	Squid Game is a different type of show and I'm all for it! I really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. I thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. I avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and I'm glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you.I definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways.Check it out! Now on Netflix!
8	9 October 2021	drpainters	Worth the watch	If you enjoy Korean movies then this is a must see. Has become a real hit, cool idea, interesting games and drama. Plenty of story to continue more seasons , I've got final 2 EPs left but have really enjoyed up to this point.
8	7 October 2021	svader	Brilliant	Typical Korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure.Was good to see a non Korean, Ali Abdul, in this.Thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world.
4	16 October 2021	President_George_Washington	FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON	Good Morrow, countrymen.Sucked in by the huge amount of hype this series has earned, I caved. Count me as one of the few who simply couldn't see what the applause was all about. I will say, that the experience is better with subtitles, the English dubbing is horrible...all dubbing is horrible.The plot has been done numerous times;13: Game of Death, is one of the best. Essentially, rich people gambling on the predicament the unfortunate "contestants" find themselves. The show spends a lot of time developing the characters, paying particular attention to their individual dire financial situation. They're all broke and need cash and are willing to do anything. Fine....but once they learn that the games they play result in death for the losers, they vote to get released. Unbelievably, they are...and more unbelievably, they all volunteer to go back and play. Their desire for the cash outweighs their critical thinking skills. It's preposterous.The oldest contestant, number 00,1 is so easily telegraphed as a Keyser Söze archetype - but the series does nothing with him. He's not portrayed as a master-manipulator, but as an incoherent babbling dolt.The biggest blunder was the undercover cop, they spend loads of time on his story...you'd think he'd single-handedly expose the operation and reign down justice. Nope...they kill him. His entire story served no purpose.The entire series is too long and the female loudmouth character is unbearable. With that, the sets were inventive, there wasn't any political narrative (w0ke junk), and they didn't shy away from the violence...for that, I think a 4 is more than fair.Fare thee well. It's hoecakes and Madeira time!
10	13 October 2021	colewaters	Must watch	Believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit Netflix. Every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on. The action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works.
9	16 October 2021	DeBBss	More Than Surpasses the Hype	It's been so long since Netflix produced something that's actually good. It's not really surprising that Squid Game arrived from the Eastern cinema, considering the Western Cinema has been dry out of ideas for years at this point. Squid Game is just such a breath of fresh air in 2021, because so far in this year all we got was trash.This show is just so compelling in almost every way. The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There's no such thing as a "perfect" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they'll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn't shy away of what people can do to each other, and that's why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn't really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It's colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show. It's extremely thrilling and it'll pull your heartstrings. It's an easy show to get emotionally invested in, and it ends in the most dramatic way possible. This is a show that I'd recommend to anyone and I really hope they make a second season, because this is the content that we need in dry times like these.
6	5 October 2021	AJ_McAninch	Over-hyped Netflix Production	Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it.
4	25 September 2021	shanayneigh	Mixtape algorithm	This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: "The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!"The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long.
8	28 September 2021	nicorip22	Good and original tv show	This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original.
7	14 October 2021	backup-50362	Overhyped, but then again, there's not alot of good shows nowadays	This is a great show to binge watch, even if it doesn't introduce anything all that new and original.The fact that it isn't American made means that it's one show that Netflix couldn't poison with its toxic political agendas. It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays.I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now.
6	17 October 2021	mike-c-b	Best show out there for the first 3 episodes	It's a breathe of fresh air to see actors not acting like god and stuck in attack-victimise-saviour loops.But by the 4th episode the main villain (in the game), after being really villainous, is treated like a hero and is given nearly all the screen time. The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral. The whole story turns into a confused cliche to skip through.
6	14 October 2021	tesswysko	The Further I Get In The Series, The More OBVIOUS It Becomes That This Is A DOPPELGANGER of "Animal World!"	Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of "Animal World!" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong. It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I'm hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!
9	4 October 2021	sriramthestranger	Terrific survival drama!!	The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!
8	12 October 2021	mikeiskorn	Wow	This is the first Korean drama I've watched while I was absolutely blown away. There were a couple of moments where I thought the story dragged a little, however it was all added for tension I'm sure. It was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done. I can't wait to see what happens in the next series.
8	15 October 2021	root_king	Great show	Great show. Korean drama that is perceivable for N. American Audience. Similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of Drama with a little unpleasantries.
5	13 October 2021	efd-10467	Only up to Ep 3, after multiple attempts get going	The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I'm only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing.I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting.The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970's.Two more attempts then I'll give up.
7	3 October 2021	pranayjalvi	An innovative concept, but finished a bit hastily	Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).
7	22 September 2021	laragi	All except the last episode	I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental "here is why" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again.
8	2 October 2021	gallagherkellie	So intense!!	Wow!! No show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. It was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. Kept me on the edge of my seat that's for sure. It had me laughing and crying and terrified.
7	26 September 2021	jakethesnake-42007	Great concept bad acting	I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!
8	12 October 2021	TheVictoriousV	A masterclass with only a few hiccups	I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (these works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it "suspiciously popular". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be "hip", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current "cool" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it "in spite of some plot holes").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden "Player 1" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It's not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn't the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's "cool" or not. Still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message.I'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse. (My generation isn't much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I'm truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go "Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"
10	10 October 2021	dumsumdumfai	Lord of the Flies x A man for all seasons...and one more	Yes, it's like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person, believes in the goodness of humanity. Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the "reasoning" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of "rosebud" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.This is a great series. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions, tense and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, bgm score, character development, set, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old men. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn't get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of humanity?
8	18 October 2021	danybur	Hell as salvation	SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children's games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What's more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg's Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid's Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences.
9	20 September 2021	therskybznuiss	Everything Korea is now more interesting than Anything Hollywood.	Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this.
8	4 October 2021	AdrenalinDragon	Two thirds great one third Squid drab	Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.8/10 for Season 1.
9	17 October 2021	sirwillisiv	Intense and radically abstract...	Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show's narrative as a debate on society's morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary.
8	19 September 2021	alaningle7	Offence or Defence ?	A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved. The only thing they don't know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive. It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale. Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention.
4	9 October 2021	peeedeee-94281	Squid Pro Quo	There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)There were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.
8	3 October 2021	nidhunmoviebuff	An ingenious, immensely bingeable thriller series!	Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!
10	13 October 2021	nkishudak	The pressure	The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don't need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!
9	26 September 2021	Ahmedfadil00	my opinion	The dose of enthusiasm and suspense is very beautiful .. but the end was supposed to be more beautiful.
7	3 October 2021	koofasa	The description of this show is wrong	The description says the players are vying for $45 billion dollars but the amount is really 45 billion Korean won or about $30 million USD.
7	4 October 2021	koofasa	Overrated	This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.
2	4 October 2021	polsixe	Bad Taste Violence Porn	Who needs to watch 455 people being murdered? Some odd messaging on capitalism and income disparity coupled with reality TV game shows. Hey ccool, look the losers don't just fall into a pool then fall into an incinerator. Give it pass.
10	4 October 2021	jere_zabala	The secret is to have the right integrants in a team, not the strongest	What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc.The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn't matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT.
10	4 October 2021	saphira_dragon-80270	Excellent!	Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!
7	30 September 2021	FKDZ	Decent Korean Adventure Drama, emphasis on drama.	I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)
7	7 October 2021	Radu_A	It's a "Kaiji" rip-off alright	While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing "Squid Game".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this "inspiration".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. "Squid Game" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's "Burning" (2018) or the Oscar-winning "Parasite". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called "The Vengeancers".
7	6 October 2021	howboutthisone_huh	I smell racism	IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.
8	23 September 2021	Mike_T-Little_Mtn_Sound_Archive	Fantastic! But where's the Lee Byung-hun credit on IMDB?	Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the "walking around" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited.
9	14 October 2021	POIguy	Squid Game . . . TV's next obsession?	When I first heard about Squid Game I thought it was really out there. After watching it, I still have that belief. I like the premise of Squid Game, and I think most of the show is pretty good. The games are fun, you learn to care about the players, and the setting is eerie. I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary. The twist at the end was pretty good, but relating everything back to betting on horses was not a good comparison. I'm excited to see if this show will return for another season.
10	18 October 2021	richardwworkman	A straight up 10 from me	And I'm hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it.
7	3 October 2021	Nightmarelogic	Dystopian tropes	If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this. It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something. It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it.
6	25 September 2021	sini-200	Okay drama, weak ending	I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.
8	11 October 2021	robawalker-77417	Original experience	This was an absolutely unique and honestly surprisingly great show. For a show based out of a different country and filmed in a different language to still have this effect on everyone universally says a lot about how good it is. Excited for the next season.
9	8 October 2021	snperera	I SEE WHY THIS SHOW IS SO POPULAR!	This show hooks you in from the start!!!! It makes you care about these characters and you form an attachment to them!!! The message and theme of this show is so powerful and relevant. I love this show so much!!
8	23 September 2021	azanti0029	Battle Royale meets The Hunger Games	An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time.
8	21 September 2021	rudygerst	Excellent until the last episode	I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.I would still recommend watching it.
8	11 October 2021	Spartan_1_1_7	An Enthralling Entertaining Experience.	Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some "Game" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn't exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you're going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I'm looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn't hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you'd expect from a "Game" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let's just say some things get revealed and they are what you'd boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren't good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn't ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it's heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you're squeamish and can't handle rough stuff, I'd highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I'll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10.
8	29 September 2021	fake_moviestar	Watch The Original Korean Dialogue!!	Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?
8	2 October 2021	pablo_moriano	OMG	Thrilling, astonishing and deceptive at the same time. Shockingly violent and discomforting but lacks of strength in the end.
8	6 October 2021	steveo122	maybe...	The inclusion of the cheesy acting and writing in the VIP segment in the middle of so much quality work was the koreans trying to broaden american interest by recreating the cheesy acting and writing usually popular in american action movies...
8	30 September 2021	adaptor	Not original but very watchable	Nothing new here but it's quite well done and engaging. There's more story and character development than you might expect from this story and that keeps it from just being generic. As with many shows, the English dubbing is bad: if recommend original Korean with subtitles. One nice thing is that because this is a series and not a movie, they're able to dig into the backstories more and that makes it more engaging and interesting than this may have otherwise been. A great addition to the genre.
8	16 October 2021	erhanipekciler	It is nice.	Well, before everybody was not talking about, I started to watch, it is different but I really don't understand why this happened so popular in everywhere. I watched better things from Korea. It is nice and different, simple games, good characterizations but for me there is a logical error, everybody hasn't equal standards in the game and we cannot talk about equality or justice. In an episode there was a dialog about that.. Anyway, it is nice and watchable.
5	16 October 2021	sakram	The more it went on, the more problems it got. (The Good, The Bad and the Ugly)	This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It's a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You'll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:This series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It's very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:The idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of "Hunger Games" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It's not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It's all great, it's what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn't do it for me).The Bad:The main character is kind of "stale" to me, it's not really someone I'd care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It's not about the actor, but the director didn't really get so clever about managing his MC's façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there's not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That's what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn't sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:Remember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven't seen him die but something about the entire side plot should've happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand "kek", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn't buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that's not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should've come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn't help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it's still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.
9	14 October 2021	alshamari-marwa	Amazing series	Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake.Season 1 : 9 episodesTop series for this year by far , the Idea💡 , the execution of the story 👏 , it shows how far need can take you and how greedy humans can be .My rating : 9/10 , IMDB : 8.2/10.
9	8 October 2021	SeriousJest	Joins Saw and The Hunger Games as an Instant Classic	This series has many of the elements that made Saw and The Hunger Games great, with enough unique iconic elements to earn its place as an instant classic in its own right. It makes you care about its rich, developing characters, played by charismatic and convincing actors. It masterfully balances extreme suspense with gruesome outcomes, but it also sneaks in endearing and comedic scenes when you least expect it. It makes insightful social commentary about subjects such as extreme financial disparities. It addresses depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. It features creative set design, props, costumes, and music that have already become the inspiration for countless memes. It will spur various conversations with your friends about all of these subjects and more.
9	29 September 2021	jasminn_tan	Deserves the hype	I only started watching because it pretty much blew up on the internet and it got me curious, and wow. I really didn't expect much from this but I was proven wrong really quickly. The basis of this show is something we're all familiar with: wealth inequality and the lines people are forced to and will cross for money, and it was the literal version of 'a rich man's playground'. The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?
9	17 October 2021	MattHankinson	Happily on the bandwagon	Everyone is talking about squid game so I will give it a go...turns out the plot is right up my street! Korean children's games where if they lose they die! Really original and fresh.Ep1 - you see most of this in the trailer but it really is one of the best episodes. Red light green light iconic.Ep2 - bit slow but building towards somethingEp3 - honeycomb ep really goodEp4 - allegiances form and tug of warEp5 - didn't really enjoy the harvesting organs doctor plotEp 6 -gganbu ep big names die in this and it's really coming towards the end now!Ep7 - glass bridge ep really good and lots more big names dieEp8 - short ep where it leads to the crescendo in ep 9 where main character ends up winning however some of his choices are frustrating. For example not trying to win the game at the end and also when he does win doesn't make the most of the money. It finally looks as if he is going sorting his life out and then he doesn't get on the plane!!! (And for some reason decided to get a really strange haircut which doesn't really suit him!)So much potential and I really hope there's a series two!
6	14 October 2021	evans-j34	Binged it but.. meh	Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we've seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good . And it does do as a good enough past time. Its just not something that needed to be a series.
6	18 October 2021	rdvljunk	interresting but not special	With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. "Memories of the Alhambra" and "Sysiphus" are much more intelligent in their script.
4	24 September 2021	poinla37	Second half dumb and silly	If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the "plot twists"/reveals so typical...I felt like I've wasted my time with this series....
1	10 October 2021	Ladiloque	Kids level stuff not suitable for kids	Watch the first episode if you can't resist the marketing hype. You'll see it's a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it's heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I'll give it a 1.Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash.
9	29 September 2021	Prophetik	Genius made show	This is a great show at first i thought "Squid Game" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show. I recommend all to watch this masterpiece.
4	5 October 2021	Go_For_The_Jugular	Great...if you watch it in reverse!	Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!But things went downhill a little bit each episode. By episode 4, I was totally over it.I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it.Didn't really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film.
10	9 October 2021	mandagrammy	A Real Page Turner... If It Was a Book	I watched Episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. I was captured right away. The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I've watched in a long time.
9	20 September 2021	eryui	Very good one	This show keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish. It's done very well from every point of view, just the police actor shoul have been less younger.I hope for a second season.9/10 Bravo.
8	4 October 2021	Badr90s	Flawed but Must watch !	This show had the potential to be one of the best foreign mini series ever streamed world wide, maybe it is for some but not for me since the flaws it kept having but covered by the unexpectd shocking events and great actors, the final episode is the reason not to give this show a 9 or 10, the worst plot twist ever happened and ruined it to be a perfect masterpiece, season 2 isn't necessary but seems like it's happening anyway.
8	23 September 2021	matrixdukenukem	Bring on the darkness	I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.
6	1 October 2021	zombie84-1	mehh	Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored.
1	15 October 2021	patrickfilbeck	Double standards, celebrating today's social abyss and pretending to be totally moral	The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out.
3	5 October 2021	jiballini64	I don't get all the rave reviews	I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful.
10	2 October 2021	julieshotmail	Entertains, educates, as it shocks you along the way	This show's massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show's multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that "Squid Game" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. "Squid Game" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like "Pulp Fiction," and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With "Squid Game," you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.
8	15 October 2021	ukproject	Excellent Bingeworthy Series	Is it just me or have American TV Series gone mind numbingly stale?Squid Game definitely has it's flaws, but it definitely offers something fresh with a different perspective. And once again as with alot of Korean productions there is no fear of treading into dark territories without a care in the world for 'Hollywood' endings or sentiments.Also unlike US productions, this story appears to have been limited to a single series.
8	2 October 2021	valentin_sieben	GG	Violent and imaginative, the SG is fun to watch.People struggle with money and get a chance to play kids games turned deadly in a misterious place were everyone wears masks. Ruthless, people start to die in each game until one is left. Wich one?
8	15 October 2021	Turanic	Battle Royale though	This might be the first major injection of Battle Royale style stories into mass media ... I think what differentiates Squid Game from other similar shows is that characters are mostly poor people with massive debts, just like most of the world I guess, unlike school kids in Battle Royale or Student aged kids in Alice in Borderland or a gaming nerd in Btoom ... The show is properly high budget , the acting is decent and the script is good, what makes the show appeal to masses, just like Lost when it came out, not many realized it's a rehashed for masses Earth 2.
8	1 October 2021	TreeFiddy53	Brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining.	The show has an interesting storyline - you can draw various metaphors (about society, capitalism) if you want to, or simply watch something with a different concept. The writing does enough to make you care about the characters.The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it. The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining.
9	27 September 2021	ferreiranazli	Marathon worthy	Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn't stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising.
5	7 October 2021	Aristides-2	Overrated	Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?
9	5 October 2021	witra_as	Deft writing and fine craftmanship made it worth the hype	Netflix K-drama might offer nothing new as a survival-show dystopian thriller but deft writing and fine craftsmanship made it worth the hype even for international audience. Some gratuitous violence over nail-biting twists and turns kept our interest till the end.Each contestants for some reasons had purposes due to rounded character developments. They took 'companionship' to next level including shocking revelations we could barely see. Convincing ensemble cast effectively triggered audience to pick sides in every deathly familiar games.My most to leave fave:1. Tug of War2. Glass Bridge3. Red Light Green Light4. Honeycomb Shape Cutting5. Squid Game6. Marble Games.
9	8 October 2021	BijeshNagesh	Stellar Storytelling	As survival series go, "Squid Game" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a "Hunger Games", "Saw", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and 'convenience zones'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung's musical scoring more than 'made it work' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another 'tricky' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other 'loopholes' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that's where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That's how I watched "Squid Game" on Netflix. The 'feel' was so much different than when I 'tested' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix's "Squid Game" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a 'dark' mark one won't soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. "Squid Game" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our 'better nature'.
7	19 September 2021	The_Swedish_Reviewer	A slowly told Survival Game series	I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.
10	3 October 2021	PeacepiperF20	Dont change a thing	Dont listen to twitter on this show its not over the top it has no deep message. Its just fine.
7	16 October 2021	nodlimax	Interesting but it has some issues	There was quite a buzz around Squid Game over the last few weeks. There was positive as well as negative buzz regarding the violence.After watching through the show in the last 3 days I can say that the show is interesting in some aspects but has issues in others.The acting ranges from good to outrageously bad for some of the characters. The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.
9	6 October 2021	nagsaptarshi	Squid Game- Another Korean Gem	I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10.
9	4 October 2021	giticomi	At the end we where all VIPS	Just a thrilling series. The camera work,sets just beautiful,amazing acting. It keeps you wanting more. At the end we all where VIPS to the Squid Games.
10	15 October 2021	ryanpersaud-59415	The Best Thing of the Year.	The Good:I don't give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can't tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you've seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It's a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn't truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it's Episodes 7 and 8. I'll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn't see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it's weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I've been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they're crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn't exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you'd expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you've watched Squid Game or not at this point. It's a masterpiece. It's the best content I've seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind.
9	23 September 2021	leonidasstathopoulos	Would you play?	A breath taking seriesA game of wealthy and pain through pleasure beasts in human form, against desperate people for money...Betting their precious lifes just for one to take the price and get out aliveWould you play?Watch it now!!!
6	25 September 2021	DaegT	Squid Game vs Alice in Borderland	Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, "handsome", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!
1	10 October 2021	indiedavid	Unwatchable	I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I gave it three episodes then just bailed.
8	4 October 2021	jsucie	Fun and surprisingly emotional	The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren't in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their "come up'ins" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn't much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you've finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard. The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you'll be like "really?". All are brutal by design. This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn't look or sound as bad as it could have.
8	6 October 2021	alexscott-35299	Brilliant television!	This show has some serious hype at the moment so I thought why not give it a go. This series is such an interesting concept, it's like a blend of hunger games and saw with some real life elements thrown in as well as some interesting Asian quirks. The way the show is set up just keeps you asking questions, the whole show is just a lot of questions really and it's great as it keeps your mind racing. Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it. It's pretty emotional at times also, I didn't think I'd be so emotionally attached to these characters but by the end I was so engrossed and found myself really sad as certain characters were eliminated from the games. Honestly believe the hype that this show has and give it a watch!
10	9 October 2021	francoischristana	Must watch!!!	Wow this show had me on an emotional roller coaster. It really makes you wonder could you really be that cold if you were in the same predicament. I became invested in the main characters background stories and rooted for them throughout the entire competition. The most heartbreaking scene was when Ali died he was very kind-hearted and the game was too cut throat. I can't believe the old man was the chairman behind this operation.
8	17 October 2021	MovieWarfare	Deserving of the hype	One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is "Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of "Fly Me to the Moon" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother's card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don't feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.
9	8 October 2021	cyifly-2	Modern Day Twilight Zone	Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.
10	7 October 2021	HotDoggyBoomBooM	Hey i remember my name oh ill lam	Man who made this and this is so emotional when grandpa knew he was cheating but gave it all up saying ganbu buddies stay and share together and so was ali who paid a price for his innocence.I wished like every show the good guys has a chance but no this one is realistic as hell.On episode 6 made me cry i miss my dad seeing gramps .Bruh they got me in the first half I'm not gonna spoil the spoiler but I did cry for nothing.
6	8 October 2021	catdogmanfish	It's okay	This is a simple formula that has been done to death "poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like "it's an study of human nature" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke.
8	3 October 2021	tariqzafar-12020	Good series but not upto the hype	I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced. It was definitely a great series. The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.
2	26 September 2021	A_Llama_Drama	Big budget window dressing	Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films ("would you rather" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of "red light, green light" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the "equality" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.
5	26 September 2021	ianwagnerwatches	Hollow Pop Art	*light spoilers of plot details*So, Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize, at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? However, this story paints the loves of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice what should be an international headline (except for one detective who decides to investigate it off the books, who conveniently informs noone of his investigation or wherabouts.As well, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: that all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them, and all participants are made aware of this fact, and despite that meaning that they and the people they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival. And yet, all of them act as if it isn't the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 225 people killed before their very eyes decided that their problems weren't bad enough to warrant throwing their lives away in a game that only one person could survive. Bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everybody who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they in fact had no reason to live or were going to die anyway, and that the only way normal life would be feasible is if they give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor; but, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer like myself to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole they could go. By the way, the last episode is damn near impossible to sit through and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.
9	13 October 2021	benxrichardson	It's a masterpiece	Every aspect of Squid Game is done almost to perfection. The character development is perfect and draws you into the contestants lives. You end up genuinely caring about many of them.The show is vibrant and fresh with dark undertones leaving you feeling unsettled throughout.The ending seems slightly forced but not enough to diminish this exceptional piece of work.
5	6 October 2021	bluefim	Far from a masterpiece but good enough	Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.
10	30 September 2021	akira-hideyo	Phenomenal	Was curious to what the hype at office was over this series. Now I understand. I agree with reviewer, rubberduckydca, to save myself the need to echo the exact same sentiments and more. Holy molly, Hollywood, watch out. Great entertainment, though, a tat bit blood curling disturbing.
10	13 October 2021	acdc_mp3	An onion of a show. One layer reveals a disturbing fact.	Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!
7	7 October 2021	shahrad	Child's Play	Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games....etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately.Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America. A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!
0	22 September 2021	Hellooo1234321	10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched	10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched/
10	29 September 2021	criscal	Drama, despair, deception	This drama has it all. The series highlights social issues while following a big group of desperate people trying to pay off their debts in a deadly game that entails children games turn bloody, lured in by a promise of big money.The simple question is how far would people go for a lot of money when they can't pay their debts. The secondary question barely touched is who would get a kick out of the killing.
10	17 October 2021	baehr_adam	No Good Deed Goes Unpunished!	Squid Game has to be the most unique show I've ever seen in my life. Everything from the music, cinematography and genius storytelling lead it to be my favorite show of 2021 and in my new Top 10 fav shows of all time...
6	1 October 2021	rchosen-193-5535	Kind of overrated.	One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.
8	1 October 2021	jdiz115	A better Alice in Borderland	Kind of the same thing as Alice in borderland except the motives, characters, and drama are done much better. I also like that most of the characters are adults with relatable issues. I'm tired of teen drama. Take note Netflix you got a winner here.
9	10 October 2021	Rayofsun71	While it isn't original. It's still very well done	Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction. Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it. But the fact that they put children's games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension. I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2. If not then it had a hell of a run.
5	1 October 2021	maakus	Definitely not deserving of the high rating.	First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes "Kamisama no iu tôri." It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from "actors" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring.
0	18 October 2021	BudoSempai	Highly overrated garbage!	"Squid Game Dethroned In Netflix's Top 10 List By A New Show" It should have never reached the top 10 list in the first place! The show sucks! Two episodes of this silliness and I was done!
6	6 October 2021	Scar38	Ok....ish.	I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting.
5	30 September 2021	bgmagic22	Decent watch	The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2.
5	25 September 2021	Healing_Process	Another interesting story that I knew would crawl into the potent trope and hardcore stereotype Asian show.	The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a "battle royale" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a "good heart" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are "forced" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, "we can win this with everyone still alive". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a "final boss" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of " saw that coming" and "give me a break" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.
7	6 October 2021	kleinjoshua-76516	Great watch, with only a few not great	Overall I love the show. Great story, of the games. Few things I don't like....the acting is sub par and feels scripted. And the main character, you wanna like the main character. And I don't, he's a sleazy Grambling addict who is really a piece of garbage. I dont care whether he makes it or not. And overall this show makes Koreans seem....cringy. Horrible people.
7	10 October 2021	blackoutH	Aiming high, falling short	First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.
9	29 September 2021	boboceaelena	Gruesome sometimes but also emotional	After "Liar Game" and "Alice in Borderland" we have "Squid game".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it's on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I'm not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from "Train to Busan" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas.
7	17 October 2021	marymcfarland-01866	Good GAWD....the English dubbing	I just started this series. I'll finish because the story is excellent. Good characters, good drama, thought provoking...all the makings of a stellar viewing experience.But in my whole life....the English dubbing on this is THE WORST and it totally takes away from the excellence of the overall story. I only speak English, and I'm finding myself taking mental notes of the million different better ways this could have been translated to make it more compelling. Seriously, the English in this series is like porn dialogue. Who at Netflix thought this translation mess was ok? Do better Netflix.
6	29 September 2021	gazzalodi	Starts off strong then gets pretty weak at the end.	The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three.
0	8 October 2021	child_of_Orion	Crazy, funny at moments, but has a depth	Didn't expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore. And happily, we don't see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts. No wonder Squid Game is so popular, it simply deserves it.
9	4 October 2021	omarcantbestopped	Would you rather?	I Felt like one or two episodes too long.Some were great and some too much monologue.Still pretty good TV version of battle Royal.Or perhaps a TV show of the movie "Would you rather".
10	19 September 2021	madonnicallysony	This show bares the truth about HUMANITY	I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.
9	2 October 2021	jon-22643	The acting is fabulous, hard to find such level nowadays	Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it's actually a game of life and death. Makes you think about the horrible life of the poor, who suffers with no future, while the wealthy enjoy.
10	27 September 2021	sayamasjad	The luckiest unlucky!	The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it. What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it.
8	3 October 2021	thorodinson-50130	Finished Squid game	Finally finished this series. This is series is sticky, i mean it stick viewer toward, full of suspense, i really enjoy its game and i didn't expect that last game ends so easily in that's point i didn't satisfy. However i think they also made 2nd season after seeing its ending gin hun (lead character) didn't take the flight. GOOD series.
2	17 October 2021	jos-dsouza	Mid way through, all is lost.	Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today's world.
6	14 October 2021	jimhtl	I don't get this	I really don't know what all the fuss is about... The acting is strong (as expected from Korean actors and actresses) but most people are talking about the plot, which to me, is nothing special. Sure there are some plot twists but there are also way too many gaps for this to be called a "classic" or "masterpiece".
8	28 September 2021	DagRos	Disturbing, provocative with some excellent characters	The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach. Original and well produced series. Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers.
10	19 September 2021	anikb-87099	Near to Masterpiece!	You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked..."Can money buy you happiness?". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).
5	11 October 2021	fatfil-414-451797	Over hyped, but Okay	I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.
7	23 September 2021	dannylee-78082	A Decent Weekend Watch	What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series. Couldn't let go of it.Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before.The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there.
9	8 October 2021	lynansaysingle	Kid's Games into Survival Game	I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.
9	22 September 2021	travisvincent	Great show, almost perfect...almost.	This show sucked me in on the first episode. The acting is superb and the plot is great. The only issue is the VIPs, that's where the acting is bad and writing fell apart. Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2.
6	29 September 2021	enjozsef	from 8 to 6 after episode 7	The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.
10	21 September 2021	riteshshergill	An absolutely riveting show but a difficult one to watch	The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions.
4	20 September 2021	FreddyShoop	Meh. Pretty much the same thing over and over.	Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you'd do in a game if it was your life versus another's life. It's got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime.
10	14 October 2021	aucottjohn	Another blinder from Korea	Hands down superb, if you aren't a fan, then you aren't a fan of Korean cinema. And you most likely watched this with English subs because of social media's hype. Go back to gavin and Stacey if that's the case.
9	6 October 2021	sumanth-05484	Binge worthy Show	Can Watchable in One Sitting , Binge Worthy Show from Netflix.
10	23 September 2021	edgarkaz	Only thing Netflix does right is foreign shows	Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.
8	10 October 2021	redkyng	Being a human....!?	It's more than just a show or very strange idea from South Korea's minds, slowly with the characters development there will be a lot of questions about life in general and especially about being a human or not... and this is the strength of the show, yes as lot of viewers I didn't like that much the last 3 episodes mainly because of the introduction of some strangers...... otherwise it is a solid show.
0	3 October 2021	jackbaumel	Another Stupid Metaphor About Capitalism	The success of the movie, "Parasite" has given RPG film makers brain freeze. If South Korean filmmakers hate Capitalism so much, its a short trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, horrible over acting. Inconsistent internal logic. Full of plot holes. Non violent scenes are devoid of entertainment and violent scenes are repetitious and disgusting.
6	5 October 2021	dlracer2	Brilliance in propaganda	Everything boils down to bad guys in South Korea. They're not Korean, or even Asian. They're European Caucasians. Get that. The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

Do you still believe humans are good?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races.It wasn't necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, it was a failure to discern how ruthless the race was becoming. I tried to plead w/them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the world "NO!" Augh!SG is a foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. SG builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' w/a twist. Here, bored positive-balance-sheeted rustlers devise a game in which they entice poor souls who are in financial straits to come out & play. What the novices aren't told is that it's a game to the death, & out of 456 players, only one will remain at the end. These Tattersalls denizens won't be participating. They prefer to watch the "horses perform"... And die.The violence is lurid, but not gratuitous.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author, stated his purpose: "I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life." He was poaching from the gauntlet of his own financial hardships.K-dramas excel at extracting every possible wince & gasp from the viewer. The horror, the absolute sickness of a Paddock lined w/ the dewy color pink, along w/other nursery colors w/ the childlike trappings, is all nauseating. It's a dread multiplier.The grim story of the cop, Hwang Jin-ho, who went there to save his brother, only to be brought down by him, is pain. Seduced by the power of the dark side, the frontman won't let his brother move in on him. The actor, Lee Byung-hun, aced an expression of suppressed grief & overt resolve to continue forward. After all, it's his brother, or him, right?Every "performing horse" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to saddlepads, it's likely the numbers have correlation to their values in Numerology. This isn't to push a belief system, but rather to add layers of meaning & depth to the script. Most of the Numerology sites offer near identical interpretations. So, let's decode what the writer is announcing. Definitions in Numerology, just like astrology, tend to be generalized, which broadens the applications. Having said that, Let's see if any of the numbers have any special significance...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach a 456 how work harder on oneself. Hard work will add value to life. 456 picked up a gganbu trainer (who is not required to be a good person) in 001.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456's friend from the 'hood,' who became a whilte collar hood as an adult. He mirrors the old man to a point. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight.#218 is for manifesting one's biggest & seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth. Business, duality, & serving humanity must also be weighed in. He knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity with the prize. He failed in his ruthless run to win the roses, but found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, the North Korean, who wants to protect her family. No surprise: 067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice, & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protecting their families & possessions is an 067's priority.>001, the old man's #, is at its most positive when running for work. It is a number for winners to indicate first place. This number represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su's, number. The # 101's primary function is romance, followed by the importance of relationships. At first blush this doesn't fit with the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let's flesh this out further.A 101's basic function is coexistence. Without it, a 101 is alone. People w/ that number can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. #101 must have grown up in an environment that failed to provide his basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition.#101 also points to eternity & the journey, that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It's a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, but that God is, so 101's should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is completed. It's sad to think that 101 didn't get emotional support or the care needed to succeed. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it's sad, nevertheless. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. 199's are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali is providing for his family. On his own. #199's goals virtually never conflict w/long-term human survival & well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive. He's also foolish to be so independent that he wagered his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is for Han Mi-nyeo, the wacky mare who Brought down #101.#212's frequently chase carrots, such as meeting new people, doing new things, & visiting unfamiliar places- often on a whim. #212 is about curiosity & adventure. 212's can be a good team member, and the energy can be sensual. A caution is to not to over jump the fence, which may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, 212's can face harsh obstacles.An additional connection to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a sorrow about them too.>111 is the doctor. A 111 won't let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven't been broken. If 111's thoughts are negative, it could be attract toxic situations & people into life.>240 is philly, Ji-yeong, who was just released from prison for putting down her abusive sire. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/a high focus on security& the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP's tell themselves. She had already sacrificed her freedom to administer justice for her mother. She's the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement is something that can be phenomenal in a 244's life. He must keep wrong at bay. & not offend the inner energy that his maker installed.>the husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing& complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we could make an 8, or the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is sometimes seen as a symbol of yin&yang. The energy of 69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal.Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for a rather traumatic phase. Whether the ending is good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change; so be prepared for it, because the the manner in which it's dealt with is going to effect the rest of one's life.Finally, upon the runners return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Contrast to these "poor," rich hacked-up GOONS. Their lives are so empteeeeee. Sigh.Up to 21% off CEO's are psychopaths. It's not a stretch to guess that some of these fulsome degenerates are in that club. They also exhibit heightened sadism. These reprobates can't seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn't get what he wanted by hosting Squid Game, which was a panecea for lonliness and boredom. It seems he & the VIP's justified their actions by deluding themselves that they were conducting a social experiment- The fact that they pit beings against each other, & reassure themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as them, allowed them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: Just look at who they really are! We're giving them a fair chance. In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied.The old man craved the comraderie he'd had while growing up poor. He felt that kinship with 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. (At the time, 456 had a second chance, too. He could have done the all-or-nothing but refused. That plot point, while needed, was his worst moment). The old man was likely playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.This kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there at his bedside when #1 dies. Where's his wife? Where's his kids?? Where's his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. The old man saved 456's 'life' a second time, by pulling the bit right toward living.456 is who he is. We see him win 3 times: Even when he wins, he's a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. He won, but his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he, again, didn't get what he wanted: The old man died before 456 could kill him. However, it did wake 456 up. He no longer had to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man's eyes during the race: He just regrets not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant.The red hair indicates that he's now either on fire or starting to blaze his trail. Finally.This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. 456's number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he'll be a stallion with #789.Quote:Good rain knows when to fall -Du Fu-
8	16 October 2021	WhimsicalMusings	It's An Upset!	Money isn't everything.Do YOU still believe humans are good?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races.It wasn't necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn't disern quickly enough how ruthless the game was becoming. I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the word "NO!" Augh!The competition in this league is greuling. Spectators usually require aquantitative easing of their emotions when investing time into this series; itJust Plain Hurts.!Fair Warning!While this review is not about spoilers, most of your know about the show's playbook. Leave now if you haven't seen the highlights (more than the trailer) yet.SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. If there's no umpire, they will always run offsides. It is a display of the mutual annihilation pact we enter when it's "every man for himself."The eventing builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' with a twist. Here, bored, specialized multipliers of their own net worth, devise a game in which they entice impoverished souls who are in a asset-liability crisis to come out and play. Instead of the fulsome, rebrobate 1-percenters participating in the contest, they prefer to spectate from their private luxury box while the "horses" perform... and die.The first two episodes focus on the wild market swings while 456's journey begins. We follow 456, who enters a limo, awakes to a surreal psychotropic trip in the lofty horse stalls of a dorm, and exits into the calamitous onslaught of Game 1. The players soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly told by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are........ Ummm.... Severe.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: "I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life." He was building on his own experience of financial irons that kept his account in the red. The script is a metaphor for his own monetary gauntlet.For those of you who are new to Korean programming: Welcome! We've been waiting for you;) K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince and gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, and overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they're in danger of their stats being overlooked.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters & dialogue, lots more blood & guts, and an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming and thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can't diversify, they win! ÷(Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer's psyche with disciplined follow-through. The horror, the absolute sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) and the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas tend to slam players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance and yield gains.456 is pathetically and painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses.... Has her ever been bullish? Not likely. He's thoroughly contemptible, and relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience's appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another's performance might lead your fantasy team to victory.K-dramas are also want to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn't account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.Every competing "horse" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it's likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology. Numerology sites offer mostly identical interpretations. This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, and provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let's see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, and signifies effort and patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check. It's applicable.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456's friend from the 'hood.' The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one's biggest and seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth.>001, the old man's # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199's are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199's goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival and well-being.Check, check, check, again.And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven't seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning.Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, and meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer's own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive and heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I'd be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster's number exposes his basic needs that clearly weren't met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456's number is sequential and shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Here's my ante-post bet and hope: In season 2, he'll be a stallion with #789.Most Important Lesson:If there are no rules, discern quicklyYah!I'm Mixing monetary, equestrian, and sports metaphors up, like a Martini, over in the corner here!!!!!! I ain't got no rules either!Is Winning Everything?.................................What's your/only/ thing? What is mine? ......... Hmm. I'll have to mull over that one.Quote:Good rain knows when to fall. ~Du Fu~
9	2 October 2021	briscouver	Do it! A must watch	I am the first to admit I'm a lazy movie watcher and am not big on dubbing foreign movies or subtitles so when I kept hearing about Squid Game I was hesitant.This movie was amazing and was such a well written and interesting story.I've seen others bag the VIPs and I agree that was the weakest point of the show but hard to fault anything else.Can't wait for season 2.
9	20 September 2021	visionandyouth	Money and the human incentive	Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2.
3	7 October 2021	normanemailer	Dubbed version	Terrible voice actor in the main character. Childish. Stopped watching. Subtitles are better.
10	28 September 2021	ibrahimkhan-30185	Better then money heist	What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix.
1	14 October 2021	petercarlsson-92297	Totally pointless	Starts off pretty well in the first episode. Then it's just downhill and pointless. The ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crapIt turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. Doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get.
3	13 October 2021	shoppsi	This is a review of the first episode only...	...and I couldn't even finish it.Maybe it gets good; I don't know, as it has so much hype and good reviews.I just know it's not for me.The main character is so unlikeable that I don't care what happens to him. Maybe he grows as a character...he probably does, but I don't care enough to stick around to see.The acting is over the top. The main character pulls faces every two minutes. I've seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation.If I ever watch the rest I'll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass.
7	27 September 2021	xetaprime-64257	First Few Episodes a 10, Then...	I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.
9	3 October 2021	honeybloggs-69648	BRILLIANT AND VERY ENJOYABLE	It was very well acted . The male lead was excellent . I did figure out the main twist in the storyline , earlier on. I'm eagerly waiting for series 2 .I've watched South Korean movies for a number of years and have always enjoyed them .Their series Kingdom is fabulous too . Hollywood needs to learn from South Korea how to make good movies and series .
4	30 September 2021	Arik_P	Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?	Answer: Do not know. Binged through the 9 episodes .Mixed feelings mixed opinions , mixed reactions,Excessively brutal and violent yet all the brutality and violence hides a hidden agenda for everyone to interpret as he/she wishes. As I watched the English dubbed version with Hebrew subtitles I can only say that the subtitles often differed from the dubbed English ,hence i believe that the translated subtitles are more close to the original Korean version that the dubbing. The main character actors give a reasonable performance while some others should keep their day jobs.So is it worth watching?-See the Subject line. I would rate it 0/10 and 8/10 at the same time. Hence I am giving it a 4.
5	1 October 2021	hakra1	Completely overrated	A hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys' Zeitgeist. The series is far away from the mentioned "masterpiece". Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special.
6	13 October 2021	deothor	It was both exhausting and entertaining	My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i'd feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate 'hunger games'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It's just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head "what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here's the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn't end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it's a 9-episode long show, the "sad ending" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it's either all or none case, sadly. I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one.
8	18 October 2021	Yrrepk	79% -- Addicting with some problems	I cannot recall a show being more popular than this one. In fact, I haven't spoken to anyone that hasn't at least started watching this show. So, is it deserving of its popularity? Well, aside from the "real-world" episodes which were, at times, a complete snoozefest, Squid game is very addicting in that it's difficult to stop watching once you get going. However, I did have a couple of significant issues.Firstly, with few exceptions, players didn't advance because they were smarter or stronger or more strategic. They kept advancing because they were luckier. If you chose the wrong shape, you're dead. If you got unlucky with your team in tug of war, you're dead. If you lost in a game of pure chance with marbles, you're dead. If you chose to go early in the glass game, you're dead. This is all good and well, *until* the black-mask guy starts preaching about how equality is the "most important aspect" of the games. The games were far from fair, so just own it, and don't introduce this ridiculous idea about "fairness" being at all important.Next, I was disappointed that the detective served zero purpose to the story aside from interactions with the bad guys. We spent so much time with him and he, quite literally, accomplished nothing. I am 100% certain the detective is still alive because there's no chance they could make a main character that useless (I'll happily amend this review once his return is revealed next season). Finally, Jung-Jae's reaction after defeating Hae-Soo was just stupid. This guy has betrayed him 10 times by now (including attempting to kill him multiple times), and Jung-Jae's reaction is to, um, attempt to end the game and give up all that money?!?! He was about to kill him the night before, before being convinced otherwise, and now he just wants to give up all the money to save his life. Come on...
9	3 October 2021	phebychow	Must watch!	It becomes one of successfully Korean dramas. Besides the brutal element, the setting of each game involves lot of tactics, eg composition of the team, your partner, sequence etc.. which determine your success rate. There is nothing relevant to distasteful Saw game! Plus all of them participate in the game on a voluntary basis!Another thing I like most is about character development. All main characters' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent. It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing.Just a bit strange. Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much. In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler. However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice. If you don't want to use the money, it's better to donate it. So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent. All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end.
5	17 October 2021	eshmana	Lame	How is this currently on a score of 8.2? The lead character was SO annoying in the first 30 minutes that I switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through.It's not a patch on either Battle Royale or the American version of that, Hunger Games.It drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat.Watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff.
2	8 October 2021	gnatsong	There Are some wonderful Korean series.	This isnt one of them. There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained. They dregs weren't much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe. The end was fitting. Bleak. The movie was bleak. Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn't one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste.
9	22 September 2021	mrvino15	some of the best acting I've seen	Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I've ever seen. Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel "truth" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan. A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch.
10	3 October 2021	scarlettimogen	Something different for a change	Great show. Brilliant acting. Apart from the VIPs who thankfully had a small part otherwise they could have overshadowed a fantastic show. The bureaus are great screenwriters and I hope this introduces people to the brilliance of Korean filmmaking (start with Train to Busan!)
8	2 October 2021	SofiCastle	This is really worth it	If you are wondering if this show is worth of all the hype, it is.Just a few flaws for me: the cop sub plot feels silly; and as usually in korean dramas, when they need white characters (the VIPs here - by the way, could you imagine a US show were all the villains would be POC?) they cast the same bunch of untalented dudes. Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea.
10	24 September 2021	ggcarbone	W10W - W10W	If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch.
8	24 September 2021	ethanjjacobs	Great show	Really good show and I enjoyed most of it, all the main characters were great and the acting was also great, the only problem I had was the VIPs, they were really weird and for such a good show you'd think they could get better actors for these characters. I also think the ending could have been better.Other than that I really enjoyed the show and it's probably one of the best Netflix originals, and the best I've seen this year.8.2/10.
8	14 October 2021	alandeza	Amazing show	This was a show that I felt loved up to the hype. The concept was a brutal, with the end result being so heartbreaking. My only gripe was that by the last few episodes I was starting to tune out a bit. Other than that, this show gets a big recommendation.
8	18 September 2021	fonnyhariyanto	you should watch until the last episode	Honestly, i skipped the story of the player's background. But when the game began to play with all the gripping game stage, its excited me. This serial is a mix between the Hunger Games and Saw. You'll never expect whose the boss of all deadly games, if you already watched Saw movies, then you'll know.
3	24 September 2021	yeolit	Shallow plot seemingly mimicked from other series	Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much "micromanagement" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the "micromanagement" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.
6	27 September 2021	jon_hsieh	Great start, bad finish.	The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.
1	15 October 2021	ashishbgm	Writer and Director of this show are psychopath	This series is so dark. Avoid if possible. Writer is seriously messed up, you can feel the negativity while watching this show. To know the question" Who are you" you better turn inward.
9	2 October 2021	spainahmad	Probably the best show in 2021!	I loved everything about this show, very engaging and stressful, yet it depicts human emotions to the fullest. Gambling on a horse race will never feel that easy anymore.
8	12 October 2021	tifa4evr	Fantastic story and brilliant direction with only one tiny problem...	I have no complaints about the story of Squid Game or the violence and gore in the story, it's actually done rather tactfully throughout, showing just enough here and there to make it worthwhile and fun to watch.The acting is top form in all respects, every portrayal is perfect and heart-wrenching in places in both how perfectly its shown and how decent it's made .Even the sets are painstakingly jarring and off-putting, that. "relativity" style primary colour hallway set is so jarringly off-putting and decently alluring at the same time, I knew on first seeing it that I'd love the set decoration and propworks.So why after all this gushing for how wonderfully amazing this is am I not giving it a 10/10?Because I want this series to be literally just this, a 9 episode story of a down-on-his-luck man with decent ambitions who goes through hell only to come out on the other side as a hero.But that ending man, that ending...the sequel bait in it is thick as 10 week in the snow syrup. And I don't want that, I don't want Gi-hun to become some warrior trying to take down the international Squid Game people. Let this be the amazing single season it is that shows even the lowest man can become something amazing when given the chance.
1	8 October 2021	cujorocky	Huh???	This show is a farce. The acting is Atrocious!!!!!! How is this drivel getting such high reviews???? It's terrible, its awful.
8	6 October 2021	mosquitocyn	Dark and disturbing interesting watch	It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me.
10	27 September 2021	brainsmasher-66	And now for something different?	Very original, very strange. I like strange. Ooh look at this, it is so cute and harmless like a puppy until it bites off your index finger.
9	18 September 2021	Almost_Soldout	Decent Korean show	I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!
5	7 October 2021	ThatAnimeSnob	A dumb variant of death games	This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.
9	10 October 2021	jonathan1995-746-926939	Liked this one a lot	If you liked Alice in Borderland then this is a good bet! Likable (well most of them) characters, suspenseful and just a fun concept in general.
7	4 October 2021	11ovz11	This was fun!	I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.Were there bad plot holes?Yes.Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes.But did that hinder the overall series?No.Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.Pros:Good actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow.Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:VIPs episodePoliceman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out.
7	18 October 2021	Zerbey	Thought provoking.	I have to hand it to the Koreans, the two things I've seen from there both had very similar dark themes - the other being "I Saw the Devil". Both of which are truly disturbing pieces of art, but you can't help but keep watching to see what the conclusion may be.The show raises some interesting questions about human nature and what drives us to do the awful things we do to one another, and you can't help but wonder if such a shadowy society producing a game like this for wealthy clients really does exist somewhere. Either way, it's a very clever concept and masterfully done.I do hear that the subtitles to English are not always accurate but I don't speak Korean so cannot comment on that. Even if they're not, I was able to follow along and I'm hoping I didn't miss too much of the plot.
10	16 October 2021	xanderlm	Amazing show!!	Absolutely amazing show. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I've seen to date. There are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all I highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you. It's much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into.
8	9 October 2021	mertafor	Top notch show	As in the title says, this show is great. Already people made detailed comments and I won't have anything futher to add. But I'd like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch.
9	12 October 2021	jannikpeveling	Love Korean thriller & drama	I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers. I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama. Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible. I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist.
2	13 October 2021	rrkawase	Hunger games revisited	Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.
10	25 September 2021	premmgor	Movie Premyy Honest Review	One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ❤
10	12 October 2021	farhanazhari05	Best Korean Series, I Ever Watch!	Squid Game is a Death Game Series, It's Looking Familiar be like Alice in Borderland, Actor & Atress is Very Good, Music is Amazing, My Favorite Round is Red Light, Green Light & The Man with the Umbrella, And The Series has Most Viral on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter & Youtube. The Series, I Giving 10 Star, I LOVE IT!Rating: 10/10.
8	27 September 2021	maytekinaliyeva	Good, but...	If we eliminate the uselessly prolonged dialogues and VIPs, it was a solid show. And when I say eliminate, I mean eliminate no pun intended ))))
1	29 September 2021	hdsimmons	Absolutely atrocious	First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here.
2	6 October 2021	ricardo-consonni	Well-made, but slow paced	This show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. I often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. This show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value.
8	10 October 2021	sn-shinde2006	It is too addictive worth binge watch!	What's Good- Yes, concept and plot of this survival drama is not a new thing, but the way it conveys with conviction has no match.It is high intense drama of human emotions like fear, greed, worrying, anxiety and humanity. Like in 'parasite', it again shows social inequality issues of South Korea.The series is a high-quality work and It's visuals are strong to build suspense very effectively.Recommending to watch original Korean audio with English subtitles. And yes, it can be addictive one to binge watch!
9	6 October 2021	helghast-1337	A great binge watch. Have to agree with the VIPs	The show is a must watch. Would have made it a 10 were it not for the VIPs. I don't understand why they came into the show so late. You figure they would have liked to see it from the beginning to quench their thirst for seeing people suffer but they didn't. They should have just cut them out of the script. Otherwise an excellent series.
10	27 September 2021	teenydutton	New creative series!	I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!
4	13 October 2021	aldo-64339	BTEC Black Mirror	What's with all the hype??My biggest problem with this are the characters. I just don't care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn.The concept is nothing ground breaking. Seen it done before and better. Also don't bother with the dubbed audio, you'll end up laughing.Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also.Overall, I just didn't care, not the worst thing I've ever seen but nowhere's near worthy of the hype it received.
10	6 October 2021	ajaynkumar	Amazing show must watch now	After money heist its next amazing bog thing on netflix ..from above it looks like only thriller but actually its a fulll package u need to must watch ...foled with emothoon and every thing that one wants in the show.
6	25 September 2021	rallder19	What the hell was this..?	I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.
10	21 September 2021	awfulketchup	Perfection!	Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!
8	14 October 2021	ilpo-surokivi	Not for the squeamish	There's a lot of blood and violence in my opinion. I often wonder which is the more accurate one. Does blood gush out if a bullet pierces a person and how much. Is it like tiny not visible droplets that couldn't be caught on camera and then there's blood pouring from the wound I doubt it's a splatter fest.The social commentary was elsewhere too but I found the voting scene most fascinating. How half of the players wanted to get the money and risk their life. I get that many of the players were desperate but can't these people get even a litt paying job rather than play in the squid game. I'll rather work at a McDonald's than risk my life.
10	18 October 2021	Humphreywashere	It is a story masterfully told- of redemption, of human frailty	I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.
4	6 October 2021	shudson-53380	Too weird	Good idea and first episode but by episode 4 i'd had enough. Too weird, violent and unlikeable characters.
8	5 October 2021	charliemouse-06733	Pasolini did better on the subject ...	It's really nice esthetically pleasing. But you have to like testosterone movies sadistic and so on . So yes Pasolini did better with.salo 120 days of salo ..But new generation forgot about this....
7	10 October 2021	cupid_shot_you	First 6 eps were great, last 3 were lame	1-6 built strong momentum.Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building. The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long.
9	2 October 2021	adotson-98233	A truly engaging, and horrific look at reality	"Squid Game" is one of the best Netflix shows to come out in a long time. It's a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations.This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes. The characters are absolutely amazing. Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others. The acting is amazing. Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real. The games too are very fun to watch. Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying. It's a very inventive premise for a show. Also the show truly made me cry. It's a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much. And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show. The show also just has a real look at what it's like living in debt. It's makes you think whether it's worth it to risk your life to get money.I have but ONE little issue with the show. The first 2 episodes are just a little slow. I feel that they could've been better paced, but that's it."Squid Game" is a truly amazing show that has amazing performances, fleshed out characters, a real look at reality, and a premise that's so creative that it's almost impossible to enjoy.
6	11 October 2021	ginlabgainz	Fun but the plot makes no Sense	Ok..it's entertaining for sure...but plot wise it does not make sense..at the end ( spoilers). It's about how can they treat people the way they do.. forgetting the fact the contestants chose to be there and could leave anytime they liked..they knew the rules and decided to play ..so why the suddeb blame on the host of the games?..all in all it's fun.. expect a few remakes from bigger better film studios..
10	2 October 2021	computer2computer	A tip, more than its being a review	When you watch S01E06 ("Gganbu"), make sure you have a box of tissues next to you... and preferably also somebody to hug.
10	3 October 2021	Valentijn78	A bloody masterpiece	Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions "betrayed" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here.
8	1 October 2021	mitchlb452	Really Good Until The End	Very very minor spoiler. The show as a whole was phenomenal, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, but the ending was weak. The second half of the last episode honestly weakened my rating by two full stars. Still worth it though.
7	29 September 2021	yooniverse	Shockingly good thriller, ending a bit weak	A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more.
8	3 October 2021	afb_bellman	Good show but.....	The shows interesting, it's entertaining, but the main character is such an idiot I wish he would have died right away.
5	25 September 2021	forthatusage	Dissapointing ending	The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.

10	30 September 2021	tanya-47873	Amazing show just amazing! But someone please update the correct actors on the IMDB page as it's all wrong and the right actors are not getting the credit!0	One of the best shows I've watched! Everyone of the actors was so so good.

6	16 October 2021	amirnikooei	Predictable	Spoiler !All deasthes can be predicted in orderSpoiler !One of the most predictable thing which can be named was the "OLDMAN" key role in the game, from the scene of "Night Chaos" that he shouted "Stop" and the "Black Man" obeyed his order.
9	23 September 2021	rune-andresen	Must watch	This is a must watch. It speaks for itself. It's violent yes, but the characters are alive with plenty of personality. Pure quality. Perfect storyboarding and addictive. Yes, the weakest part is the WIPs but the rest is perfect.
0	7 October 2021	hanaahbraan	Misogynistic, ageist, racist brain rot	Last century misogyny, foul language, ageism, casual racism, greed and despair - basically everything that's wrong with South Korea today, and which would be outright rejected if this was a Hollywood/Western production. It's amazing how a few bits of cheap brightly coloured scenery and silly costumes can get people excited about what is a very old and trite concept. Yawn.
10	29 September 2021	tunesplitter	amazing and different	It is worth watching.The first season was awesome. Interesting concept. The problem is, that a lot of it is predictable.
7	30 September 2021	ronaldmpofu	Good show but the ending sucked balls , Pardon my French.	If you are looking for a happy ending look elsewhere. The ending was meeeeeh but just give it a try. Great acting here.
8	17 October 2021	Akash_Menon	All aboard the *Money Heist Train*	Rating: 8This show was identical to Money Heist in so many ways. The costumes, the plot, the way how people tackle situations and obviously Netflix. Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn't find the plot as completely new and offbeat.

8	9 October 2021	edwin-wks	A limp to the finish line	Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.
1	9 October 2021	karimnn	Absolute garbage	I watched two episodes and I had enough. There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long.
8	19 September 2021	doubtitall	Extremely good dark action thriller except for one major flaw.	The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.
10	15 October 2021	PeteThePrimate	Excellent - well written & acted.	If you can deal with the graphic violence you'll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended.
9	24 September 2021	a_filmcritter	artistic storytelling, visual masterpiece	Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytellingCons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators.
4	2 October 2021	abhijeetjeetubest	Predictable!	The series uses recurring theme of anime like jujutsu kaisen, btooom and movie like Tournament, Gun Akimbo; tries to put together set of events which are predictable and characters which you cannot relate to. And to make that happen there is very stupid premise of VIPs and debt for which people are ready to kill and die for.
7	9 October 2021	lanycera	The last 3 episodes didn't conclude it well.	I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. "Gganbu" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the "one" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall.
4	17 October 2021	stewartcarl	totally predictable	Not in the same league as a lot of korean stuff,its a steady series thats about it,most of the caracters in it are as dumb and thick as dogs💩,and it dose'nt take no working out whats going to happen at the end.
4	4 October 2021	hydralien-40230	Pointlessly bloody	It's hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it's expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it's just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.At the same time it's hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they're not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above.
9	11 October 2021	sanjeevanwar	Dark and intense	Anwar Says : Last week, there was absolutely nothing to watch on Hindi OTT and I decided to go for much talked about Squid Game on Netflix, a Korean dark and disturbing series. 9 long episodes and would force you for a binge watch.You have everything in the plot , childhood games , killing, inhumanity, hatred , emotions, sentiments , and above all mind game . Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly. If you loose you are killed and your guessing is not correct every time. Don't want to be a spoiler, so not narrating the story and the games .The lead Lee Jung- Jae gets answers to all his questions in the last episode.Watch the series with sub- titles on , in spite of the fact the dubbing in English is of quality par excellence . The masked jump- suits used by the guards are going to be the favourite this Halloween . Already running at top spot since a fortnight.9 out of 10 from me .#Nerflix#anwarsays#SquidGame#koreanseries#LeeJungJae#review#webseries#childhoodgames.
9	5 October 2021	harshdubey-03287	Unique & out of the league, but...	This show shows us the hypocrite nature of humans and how they can turn into monsters when the things come to money & self life.But at some instances the plot was predictable like in E2 (voting stops at 100-100 and the last man will decide the result), the front man turns to be the police officers brother and the last episode ended at such an anti-climatic note (sang woo kills himself for what? After returning from game Gi hun forgets about his daughter for whom he wants to be a good father)
3	10 October 2021	dtlacey78	I don't get it.....	I really don't get the hype. Done 5 episodes now and find it all rather boring.Maybe I was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to Battle Royale....?
8	3 October 2021	DANTEfromDMC	GREAT SHOW BUT VERY POOR ACTING	Overrall it is a good show and the only concern i had was the acting it felt so cringy and annoying at the same time and i skipped so many scenes bcz of very poor acting.
3	9 October 2021	Mr_Avenger	Too much violence	I saw this drama cause I am a Kdrama lover .But it was not for me. From the first till the last episode was reproduced violence in every way. Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.In my opinion only the last episode tried to "save" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don't bring happiness.
9	26 September 2021	mungunbayarbatbayar	New standard/Great	Koreans now to the Emmy awards. Great, surprising.But ending is disappointing. Maybe It's because of there's another season ..
9	11 October 2021	siennacolucci	they were lesbians and they were in LOVE	Literally gave this a 9/10 all because of how intensely obsessed i am with 067 and 240. That's it and that's all.
9	11 October 2021	PriestMarmore	Definitely a must watch if you haven't	Firsts things first, the series is really well made and has a very well thought and written story.Speaking of story, this one was super realistic in regards to what would happen if such a situation were to happen, the only 2 problems I had were thinking of a way someone could be that rich to afford such facilities and to buy a island for themselves while keeping everything unsuspicious. Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there.
6	15 October 2021	eronzierjoly	Too long and slow paced, but alright	I watched this because everyone else already had. And it was supposed to be ground breaking.It is far too long. I was just sitting there waiting for the next game to begin. Would have been better as a movie. The bad ending didn't help.I had to resist the urge a couple of times to fast-forward to the last episode. How it became so popular I have no idea. But it was alright.
8	4 October 2021	TinyThoughts	Totally bingeworthy.	Terrible VIPs and second to last episode was trash, but in whole it's great, recommend to watch.
6	25 September 2021	suego-49293	The story is intriguing, the dubbing is very poor	I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).
9	2 October 2021	nalindra-ferdinando	Great show!!!!	Despite the moody grim nature of the show it manages to pull off great thrills, human drama and most importantly hope and an ending that satisfies giving hope to its viewers. It doesn't try to be ultra realistic or end on a depressing grim note which is why I loved this show!!!
6	20 September 2021	mick118	Entertaining but slow and poor plot	This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre.
3	11 October 2021	tavives	Not really getting what some others are seeing in this.	This is a very strange series. It's like a cross between Logan's Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M. C. Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don't know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their "winnings" from how they were acquired? And while the "1 year later" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but I don't think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone. And wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It's a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky's waltz from "Serenade for Strings", Strauss's "Blue Danube" and "Fly Me to the Moon" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.But again, seriously......WTF!!!P. S. How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?
10	3 October 2021	tracy-97320	EPIC tv show	Thoroughly enjoyed this show, waaaay out there, but so out there it was truly captivating!
8	3 October 2021	georgewhittingham1	Good show - super over hyped though	This is a good show; the concept is good, the acting from the main cast is solid, it deserves to be watched by the masses.But; it's not a great show... it has some plot holes, as well as some terrible acting by the American characters (I won't include any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll know what I mean)All I've seen these past few weeks is the serious hype surrounding the show, and as someone who is a bit of a film buff, it needed an honest review. Go watch it, you'll enjoy it, but please don't claim it as the best show ever.
6	8 October 2021	Money4Nothing	Overhyped	Ok first and foremost hear me out, it's Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you're not missing anything.
7	17 October 2021	krisztinaobrien	Interesting insight	Life is boring when you are a billionaire. Gripping with anxiety but futile and aimless if you poor. One gets excitement the other gets money and aim. Where is all to lead? Have a look.
9	26 September 2021	brucecsnow	Shocks and pulls you in	Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don't give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained.
10	19 September 2021	cjmoviebuff	Loved this!!	Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb.
9	26 September 2021	xeniamd-35210	Intense!	Intense. Massively intense!!!Games. Choices. Money. Decision.Oh what a twist! Salute to the Scriptwriter and Director, Hwang Dong-hyuk!Cheers to all the actors! It made me scream and cry!9.5/10#SquidGame.
7	17 September 2021	Snownoise	A satire of korean society and nostalgia	5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.
5	8 October 2021	Cyniphile	I was wondering if the acting was bad, or if it was lost in Korean...	...But then I saw the American actors that play a role and I knew that all the acting was really bad.Starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. Had a hard time paying attention by the end.
8	30 September 2021	jack-39973	Why the hype??	Squid Game is a solid show but that's it. I don't know why there is such a hype about it. This show is just a few weeks old but already overrated...
9	20 September 2021	mattcurtis-50459	46 Billion Squid	With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again...
1	28 September 2021	ebtsamryad	SAW rip off	It started good but end up pretentious.There were many things left unexplained like1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character .
8	21 September 2021	zachary-68690	This is one of my favourite Korean shows now.	The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The "games" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt's great, watch it.
9	6 October 2021	tpcatoz-90650	A pleasant, thrilling surprise	When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.
5	27 September 2021	shirlone	could have been better	Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.
2	10 October 2021	mahraj	No geniuses here.. Underwhelming and predictable	The messages of this series were too negative. The topics have been done before, but this series shows worse versions of the topics.Nearly everything was predictable. Stupid decisions are made. Don't understand what all the hype was about. Won't be watching the second season. If any.
1	25 September 2021	ASBKnight	Meh ...	I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it.
10	29 September 2021	skanklover_69	Saw meets Oldboy in a nutshell	Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.
6	4 October 2021	indiana1981	Slightly overrated	This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the "raging hype", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema.
10	3 October 2021	gabby-1234	You have to watch it	I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.Just watch and you won't regret it. I'm becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once.
4	5 October 2021	NixSar	A hole in search of a plot	It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama.Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well. Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist. It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show's problems) just cannot bear out.
9	9 October 2021	atharvagosavi-45998	Lack of one thing only!	I think this series is great and different experience for all the entertainment lovers.. Only lacks at emotional elements cause i think it would be great if they develop more moments..Otherwise this is entertaining at many portions.. Stretched at some portions.. Thrilling at time.. Horror in elements and emotional in parts!!
3	30 September 2021	pjkblue-35926	BLAHHHH...	I've watched a ton of Korean series and films and to say this was good is overstating.The premise, the storylines are nothing new, it's been done a lot over the years.Just has more CGI Bells and Whistles.Sorry, but I can't recommend this slop.Easy to figure out that The Front Man was the cop's brother...Lots of blood and headshots...I was stunned that the bathroom sex scene was there...None of the characters made you actually like them or pull for them...If they make another season...that's punishment enough.
9	27 September 2021	toxarbb	Great "shoot" Korea	This serie could be on the top so many years.Variety of games, colors, act, scenes, suspense and even reality, who knows? Jaja.Great 1st episope at the half of it starts the action2nd one was like... oh no are they gonna leave the games??Later on the games are spot on and the only downside is the end. Although we know for sure it will be 2nd season.Just waiting for that.
8	25 September 2021	rajashakaziz	Outstanding	I was hooked into the series right from the start. It has a good plot and getting to know the main character. From there it is a blast. Some people may find it disturbing, but it is a part if the show. You will have to watch it. Only down side is the last episode.
5	29 September 2021	nikhilnssn	2hr movie converted to 9hr series	Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTIONIdle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.
9	30 September 2021	bangotti	Another gem from South Korea	I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films.
10	18 October 2021	david-fernandez	An absolute masterpiece	Squid Game is essentially a terrible indictment of society whereby contestants are so downtrodden and made desperate by life in the real world that they're willing to enter a fabricated, deadly gameshow world to solve their real world problems with money. Although this show demonstrates that money certainly doesn't solve everything like you think it will. The show also highlights that as with real current events in the early 2020s, some elites are bored and perverted and take pleasure in having people abused and exploited for their entertainment. This series has got it all, great action, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, co-operation, revenge, family, greed, horror, plot twists, suspense and some very touching moments.Everyone involved with this production should be proud of themselves, the set designers and builders, the lighting technicians, the actors, the director, the writers, the people that chose the music and costume design.
9	17 September 2021	ambisai	"Hell" that you will "love"	If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !MUST WATCH.
9	17 October 2021	rahulwadhwani-52617	One of the most well made show in the history!	#SquidGame, I believe each & every game, each & every episode was almost perfect! I believe I never felt any boring scene throughout the series despite 1 hour long 9 episodes. Every game is edge of the seat moment, the way director created emotions at the end of marbals game that was Outstanding. That old man & Ali was phenomenal. The lead 3 character were fantastic throughout the series! Only VIP's acting wasn't good as needed but it doesn't create any effect on the series! A Definitely must watch series!
9	5 October 2021	ahmxd	Unique Show.	Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2.This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout. Only minus was very bad VIPs acting.
2	1 October 2021	AJx91	The Idea Is Not New	Saw films, Gantz anime, Alice In Borderland tv series, High Rise Invasion manga, and more have done this formula. Some of which have done this formula better.The only thing that Squid Game adds new, is that it is South Korea's own take on it, with a kdrama spin.At max, this is a 6 star at best, and a 2 star at its' worst. I'm just not as entertained, compared to other kdramas and survival game narratives (as listed above).
2	2 October 2021	kskmah	Wow, but not in a good way.	Sorry folks, this is not good. I don't know why there is so many great reviews. The main guy is an idiot and loser and not likable at all. But that is not the bad part. Why would you participate in something you have no idea what it is? They will offer you lots of money if you win? You don't think it could be dangerous? No one asked this? All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing. They never mentioned that you can't quit in the first episode. I would say f this I'm out after the first game.
8	11 October 2021	burgerman93	Quality show and extremely suspenseful	One would think that a miniseries centered around a gameshow would be stale after a while, but this series is top notch. I did think some elements of the story were hard to grasp, however the show was suspenseful and included an interesting range of characters.The only downside for me was the finale. I would have expected more character development from GiHun.
5	6 October 2021	kyrross	Great idea, well executed, outdated trope and over the top acting	I get why this show is so praised. The idea is simple yet very well executed. The asthetic and decors, and musics are amazing. BUT, the dialogs, the script and the acting are way over acted. Nobody talk like any of the character and it is sometimes really awkward. It is even more obvious when VIP talks. It is painfull to watch.There are all the stereotypical characters we have seen a million time : The benevolent hero, the cool/cold chick, the mysterious connection, the old wise man, the pure villain.... and when you start to think about the entire plot, nothing make sense. Also, the twist ending is way too predictable. I called it on episode 2 and then told myself ''no, they wouldnt go there, it is way too easy''. Yep, they totally did. This show could have been made in the 80's and then maybe, they would have some original idea. Aside from the premise, a lot of trope are copy paste from american's thriller.I was dying lauging when the face scan his mask.
8	10 October 2021	madden-brad	Watch with subtitles not dub :-)	Good show. Interesting characters. Well produced. Stellar acting.
8	9 October 2021	blankyblank	It started great but got predictable and was wrapped up too quickly	First six episodes are great - excellent introduction of characters and how they got here, careful world-building, clever and shocking games with increasing suspense up to episode 6 which is the peak of the showBy episode 7 there are about 20 players left, with a couple of "important" characters. That's where the show goes downhill:the fifth game is almost entirely luck based and running order practically determines who will pass. It also weeds out a lot of players giving us finalists out of nowhere-the winner is predictable and almost all uncertainties are removed prior to the final game, that confrontation felt emptyVIPS are abomination and ruin these last 3 episodes by a lotThe cop - lost brother plot resolved in a very underwhelming wayFront man is still a mystery - how he got to that position and why, his only redeeming quality is cool maskThe host and the grand scheme are also very underwhelming and predictablethe 1 year later epilogue is just depressing, maybe that was the intentionAll in all, I feel it could've been better. It's like they've run out of ideas towards the end.
3	10 October 2021	ramosaral	What do people see in this?	I fail to see what got people so hyped about this. It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written "twists" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment.
6	17 October 2021	rubendh	Fair-to-Middling	To be honest, the first time I found out about "Squid Game" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children's games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, "The Squid Game" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10.
10	12 October 2021	absam-50554	Magnificent short show.	Actually, i didn't watch any korean movies or series before. But i believe that no one denies that this show is one of the greatest shows "this year at least".
8	1 October 2021	AlienRefugee	Awesome show but there are quirks	The American voice actors don't really have the passion that the real actors have, so if you can live without the English dubbing then watch it with subtitles. Trust me, you'll understand why if you rewatch parts with the English overdubs. Also, there's a fair few writing issues and plot holes that may be just due to the way it was translated so it's not a flawless series but it's still a great series despite these letdowns.
10	26 September 2021	badcgishark	An outstanding series that captures the best features of its contemporaries	Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series.
8	7 October 2021	danisbelmm	.. Overrated show...??	Kinda sad Korean dramas had to "westernize" themselves this much to go trending. The show isn't bad but it isn't jaw dropping. It has none of the charms kdrama lovers enjoy that are exclusive to the Korean culture. This is another western show with Korean people in it.
8	1 October 2021	akshayjv-05222	Definitely worth your time	It's definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn't have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don't like korean drama can enjoy it.If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time.
9	19 September 2021	Kanzaki_ken	Excellent series	Other says Alice in Borderland has much intensity especially in episode 3 . But squidgame, it has a heart, loyalty . It's a mix of As God's Will, Triangle (2011) that ship scene.
6	3 October 2021	majoreasy	Interesting and entertaining	This series gets a 6 overall...For the concept and cinematography, this deserves a 7... Well filmed and good use of lighting and colours... The costume was vibrant and eye catching but rather bland after a couple of episodes... Some parts felt disjointed and out of place...The script in terms of story and logic gets a 6... Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected..."normal" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards "friends" and a few overly warm towards "adversaries"...Perhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren't 'likeable' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren't believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don't feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn't help...Can't say much more without giving spoilers away... Overall, quite enjoyable but not one where I felt the need to keep chasing the next installment... Continue watching was to just check if my prediction is somewhat accurate instead of a need to find out what happens next... This point is where I feel the series is a let down...Combining the above assessment, an average score of 5.5 to 6 seems fair... Wish they paid more attention to the details... Game of thrones this isn't, well maybe just a below par season 8 of GOT... "Could have been much better" is the general feeling...
6	20 September 2021	nilsurban-50399	Solid, but nothing more...	This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.
7	9 October 2021	michalklebs	Downhill from half way through	Interesting Korean take on Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Good start with intrigue and character building until it became boring, pretentious and predictable cliché.
1	8 October 2021	IAmRightAndYouReWrong	Predictable and overrated	Overhyped show for CW teens. Don't trust other reviews.
3	10 October 2021	penttis	I dont get the hype	I gave it 4 episodes in the hope it would be something different from what I have seen before.
6	3 October 2021	xingyi_hk	It's good...? I can find more which on-board this week in Netflix.	To be honest, it's cliche, nonsensible & horrible art-design. Whole storyline is quite boring. We can see the aim-system bypassed the old man at the very beginning, and we know there's something on it.It get the high ratings, but beneath it's not a bad tv drama series, and that's all of it - just a not-bad one.
7	18 October 2021	metalgear800	Entertaining but could've been better	I like it, but I don't love it. I would've loved to love it though, since it had great potential. I like the plot and characters. The set dressing is pretty cool. Even the soundtrack is pretty nice. The fact that it's a Korean production just made it feel like something a bit more curious to me. But it had three predictable elements in its plot that made me like it and not love it. Without spoiling it, it involves the detective's missing brother, a certain player and the outcome of the game. I would still recommend to watch this series if you're a fan of the genre.
10	4 October 2021	shawnyu64	A Masterpiece	Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!It's near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are:1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it's lost in translation)2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world's richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script...
8	19 September 2021	vam-vm	Original and creative.	A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it.
5	5 October 2021	district-23105	So. Much. Potential	Squid Game could have been an amazing show, but at an average of 55 episodes, it's filled with so much bloat.It needed to be 6-8 half hour episodes.It is fantastic, stylishly shot and has so much going for it, but boy does it need an edit. Episode 2 was entirely pointless and ridiculous in the extreme.So much I could say, but I'd love to see a vastly cut down version, or a 2 hour movie - the running length is really the only thing spoiling what could have been truly legendary.
8	4 October 2021	joncolley	Fantastic series let down by a slightly meh finale	Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!Ok, rant over lol.I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other "stuff" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards.
9	17 October 2021	shubhnegi-98254	🦑Bloody🌈Colorful👩	What a Beautiful show this was!.. It'll make you think about yourself, the people, life & everything else that 'matters'.. &🥂Cheers to everyone involved in this amazing show you all did a really amazing job Everything was just Top Notch!🎭✨Negatives : 1. A bit predictable but still i washooked.2. The dialogues (& acting) of VIPswas meh.I've seen so many movies & shows from South Korea & they never disappoint do they!?P. S. For the haters - 'Hating on popular things doesn't make you a cool or interesting person' XD.
10	24 September 2021	Kamil_An	Korea have outdone themselves; masterpiece	The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2.
9	24 September 2021	sheikhadil-64637	Masterpiece!	It's one of the best series I have seen in my lifeThe VIPs give some boring scenes to the showBut it still the show is 100% worth watchingIf you have a good heartI watched it in 1 day.
9	24 September 2021	sheikhadil-64637	Masterpieces!?	Just binge the whole 9 episodesAnd I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look afterThe VIPs give some boring scenes to the showBut the show is still 100%worthIf you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for youI will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart.
10	16 October 2021	ckmpuj	A darker hunger games	I thought I cried during the hunger games, yeah no. This was more than I could've ever imagined. Very eye opening to what our world can and could be like. Very happy they released this when they did, this show is phenomenal.
7	5 October 2021	nielssloos-17186	Almost perfect, but fails to stick to the bigger idea	Squid Games received a lot of buzz since it came out and it is easy to understand why. Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'The Cabin in the Woods'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like The Cabin in The woods ended. The anti American propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.Pros: the games, the violence, references to inequalityCons: plot twist, predictability, ending.
10	24 September 2021	lucylou3700	More please!!	Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show.
10	3 October 2021	keezo9uno	An out of the blue masterpiece.	People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they're right; however, to oversimplify the show as another "Dystopian Future Game Show" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow. I look forward to where this story goes.
1	10 October 2021	davepasnthru	An indictment of the Capitalist System from a Marxist Point of View	What you must understand about Squid Game is that it fundamentally hates capitalism. It sees unequal OUTCOME us being unfair. One comment said something to the effect that "Capitalism claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of wealth". NO IT DOESN'T! Capitalism idealy offers equality of opportunity, not equal or even just outcome. If you think you want EQUITY (equal outcome regardless of opportunity or effort) then you are probably a Marxist and are destined for disappointment. It has failed everywhere it has been tried.Capitalism, on the other hand, has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system devised by man. This is an indisputable fact. Do people get left behind? Yes unfortunately, which is why there are systems in place to help those people. But at no time has Capitalism offered "Equity" of wealth distribution.There is more and more of this kind of thing coming out of South Korea and you would think they would know better given their experience with Marxist North Korea.
10	29 September 2021	astom_23	Wow Man, Este show es FANTÁSTICO y triste	This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money.
0	13 October 2021	MNR87BPF	It was okay until the VIPs showed up	First of all. I like Korean cinema. Memories of murder and Burning are among my top 10 favorite films of all time.The show has been hyped everywhere and I actually didn't want to see it right away. But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.I try to make it simple and I don't make it up.I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.And this goes along with every thing in the show.Examples:Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would've been funnier if it didn't work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn't an important character.The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would've loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would've been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he's safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn't happen.Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn't find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would've like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn't happen.The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.To me it really went difficult when the 'VIPs' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn't barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should've been introduced earlier. They weren't even needed at all. If you'd take them out it wouldn't have changed anything and it would've even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn't match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn't even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It's like having a French character and calling him 'Guy Frenchman'.However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff. And I will watch the second season if it comes. I also liked "Sweet Home" which is also a Korean show with monsters and all around one house. It kind of went nowhere in the end, but I actually liked that one more.
6	12 October 2021	cameronmcclure	Started off with serious flare and lost momentum	I've watched too many power house Korean movies for this to have much of an impact on me. Sounds very pretentious me saying this but if you've watched movies like Oldboy, memories of murder, chaser, I saw the devil, (these are just scratching the surface) then you'll know exactly what I mean. This just doesn't hit the same way they do, I feel like this could possible be because it is being released on Netflix but whatevs - I wasn't left gripping my seat the same way they do.Might not be a good thing honestly comparing this series to them with being completely different premises, but honestly this doesn't come close. What I love about this show is that it will open up a lot of people who aren't particularly regulars with watching something foreign, and show them what is out there to dive into and will break that barrier of entry down to make them go discover more film from this absolute master race of film makers, actors and story tellers. Mark my words NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN THE KOREANS. It's just a shame that because the popularity this has seen so far will start to cloud over the absolute master pieces these people are capable of and have produced.
10	26 September 2021	gingeryzane	Incredible. Do not listen to the VIP reviews - Read Below.	The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!
6	23 September 2021	Benukra	Has been done many times before.	Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.

A 6 or 7 for me	Some of it was good, some of it very good, some of it not so good.My frowning moments were:*** spoiler alert **** When they started killing each other, 27 people in total: too soon and over the top. Here I considered giving it 5 stars at most.* The ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* The English speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don't recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could've been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would've been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could've shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don't believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would've been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should've been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should've done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He's a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn't go see his daughter, doesn't share some of the money he won with the really poor. And his sudden change of morality just didn't ring true with me.BUT, having said all this, after seeing the similar series "Alice in Borderland", I have to say I thought this way better. It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I'd still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great. And - I came back to add this - it really WAS very colourful and creepy (those masks, with different ranks according to symbol, and the private island), and not mainstream, and very entertaining.
5	10 October 2021	dapinder-jutla	Just average	Series lost its thrill after 5th EpisodeJust an average show.
2	19 September 2021	onze-kris	Good until episode V.I.P	So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show.
5	16 October 2021	redn_path01	TLDR Review for people in a hurry	This is a show written for and by mainstream human brains that are obsessed with social connections, and enjoy spending every waking minute contemplating about the meaning and weight behind social interactions.It is not good material for those of us who repurpose our neurons for more interesting things.It is possible to skip 70% of the material without losing sight of the simple story construct, and you still get to claim to have watched it.
9	25 September 2021	Abdalwahab-93	Well Written Korean Drama with Great Acting	This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!
6	3 October 2021	RoadSideAssistance	Okay but terrible ending and this has been done MANY times before....	Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with.
1	11 October 2021	richardjerome	Trash !!!! What's with all the hype	Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.Easily predictable on what happens and who's who.The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i'd throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross.It's not unique it's not different. It's all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surpriseIf I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done.
1	29 September 2021	AhmedMw2	Really !	The people's bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.
9	27 September 2021	sfx-882-826031	Intelligent, Thoughtful, Violent & Interesting	So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don't worry about the bad VIPs, they're not in it for long and the masks are beautiful.
7	20 September 2021	kristi_ocampo	Not for the faint of heart!	Probably one of the most cliché, "battle royale" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked.
5	20 September 2021	aliahmedashraf	It's good until the cop dies	Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he'll pay them in full "next month" but we learn that he hasn't touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun's mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop's brother "won" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl's little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they're crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn't shatter. It webs up as we see on a car's windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn't seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn't the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?
6	14 October 2021	ommik	Good, but not great	I really loved the first few episodes, but soon the magic started waning for me. There were too many predictable and pointless subplots, and the level of melodrama started to get too high for my taste. Also, there were a couple of outrageously homophobic moments.All in all; the show was good and I enjoyed it, but expected something more based on all the hype.
9	8 October 2021	nbutcher-69458	Playground politics for grown ups.	Dong-hyuk Hwang starts out with what seems to be a typical Korean drama and by the end of it we've been through "Battle Royale", "Hunger Games", "Eyes Wide Shut", and a Bond movie - complete with plot twists, Kubrik-esque visual easter-eggs, and social commentary delivered with a side-dish of disturbing trauma.Squid game is about a group of people recruited to play lethal games for prize money, but it is more than that. It is a commentary about the nature of human competition, the endless class war, the illusion of wealth. Read into it a bit more closely and you'll all about the levers of control our governments and rulers have over us all.The most obvious theme is the love and sacrifice that others have to make for us to succeed in life. Some people seem to think that this is a critique of capitalism, but capitalism isn't a zero-sum game like Squid Game is.With this deep commentary underlying the action - being carefully shown and not told to us - Squid Game is an unmissable watch.Negatives? The ending was a bit flat. It flirted with the idea of tying up all lose ends into a satisfying thematic conclusion - but in the end, the actual conclusion was a little less than satisfying and opened up more questions than it actually resolved. That's perfect for a sequel season - if we get one.
9	19 September 2021	JTReviewsPlus	An interesting premise that's expertly crafted all around	Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the "kids games" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.
9	26 September 2021	teacherianmitchell	Stunning television	If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended.
2	5 October 2021	marinamaru	really?	Everything is predictable and nothing surprising happened about who survived the game and what happened at the end...the games had nothing like intelligent mind game, they are just a bunch of gambles plus trial of muscle strength which is completely a disadvantage for women. The masterminds, the fellows, rich vips, people who showed up in business scene etc are all male, also there were full of misogyny and insulting lines to women which supposedly old stereo type stupid males came up with. As a person who lives in an asian country near korea, there's no wonder. Those elements were just disgusting and there was nothing fun to watch this show. I just kept watching it expecting something mindblowing would happen at the end by high scored reviews but NO nothing at all. I just waisted my time.
7	27 September 2021	newkrejados	A few holes	It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all.
9	4 October 2021	personalacc-87247	Enjoyed every single one of the episodes!	Everyone gave their best except for the VIPS.Great series to watchHats off to the director!
1	14 October 2021	schrilax	Overrated garbage	Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time.
0	2 October 2021	Tom54735	Over hyped	Classic example of the madness of crowds. How it has become so popular so fast means there is an agenda somewhere to push this.
7	3 October 2021	Always_green86	Worth the watch 💯	It started off slow but picked up and starts to catch your attention Quick after the plot is revealed...the Characters are interesting and by the middle of the show your already explained of most of their roles. Definitely something different from most recent series.
6	18 September 2021	thaicoons	Great potential ruined by overacting	Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great.
10	1 October 2021	WhoMadeYouGod	Wow	Honestly wow - from the first episode I sat wide mouthed, what am I watching and why - I didn't care.This series is amazing, it's brutal, it made me cry - what a watch.Suddenly you don't care about the subtitles, they pale into nothing, they don't matter - you find yourself watching this, reading effortlessly.An amazing series, thank you!
8	1 October 2021	susanneburns66	Fantastic show....but..	I didn't think the lead actor was likeable in the first episode but found myself rooting for him after episode 2. The games were so creepy. Children's games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there's a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i'll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors.
9	4 October 2021	Terry-Perch	Loved it	Personally found it to be somewhat of a combination of Saw, Hunger Games and Parasite, though very original in its own way.A great new TV show to binge (but maybe not with the family)
8	3 October 2021	lsalsa29	Great show. Definitely worth a watch	This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn't understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too.
9	5 October 2021	techfilz	Totally unique & thrilling series	Gripping South Korean take on a Battle Royale theme, based around playing games for a huge cash prize. The Aesthetics are memorable & the competition relentless. Kudos to Netflix for taking such original regional content on. Its like nothing I have seen before.
10	26 September 2021	victoria-cal62	10/10	This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2.
10	10 October 2021	adriano-40012	Deserves all credits	I do love Korean music, movies and series. So I'm overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I've seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.10/10.
10	8 October 2021	kvamsisrinivas	No words	Superb series mind-blowing suspense thriller novel drama all mixed.
3	18 October 2021	handcrafted	Torture from the East	What is it with Japanese and Korean Culture ....they love torture and humiliation.Like their game shows there is always an element of sadistic danger...look how they treated prisoners of war...
10	7 October 2021	priyagoswami-94472	One word description - Either choose Money or Love & Humanity.	It is disturbing in a way that why the hell is happening this ?But I have to say that the plot is unique ( Not in a good way or bad way but very dark grey i guess ).Okay, At last my opinion is one should watch this.
7	10 October 2021	dystopian-galaxy	Very compelling until...	I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn't really serve any purpose either.All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn't as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn't a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing.
6	6 October 2021	orgrabbit	Okay?	I'll give this series a high 6. A lot of clichés and familiar tropes collide here. I would definitely watch another series if it were offered though, as there are many avenues for this to go. If you're young, or don't watch a lot of movies/series, the hype is for you. Enjoy.
2	1 October 2021	AhStuttgart	Ridiculous nonsense.	TV made for violent lowbrows. Parasite was rubbish, this is even worse.
9	15 October 2021	danieldraper-99151	Great Job! Squid Game for life!	Squid Game offers a breath of fresh air into 2021's drama/thrillers.With unpredictable twists around every corner, excellent acting and writing, this show is taking the world by storm - and for a good reason.
8	16 October 2021	Applecrumbless	Average thriller with A Class cameos	The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn't really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!
10	6 October 2021	dommyblanco	TIMELESS PIECE OF ART	Brilliance at its finest. Correlating with modern times and capitalism, the symbolism and valuable lessons in this show make this emotional thriller a must see. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk along with his talented cast, create intense dialogue, beautiful visuals and scenes that are absolutely unforgettable. Watching this was refreshing and exciting.
3	17 October 2021	ontheis	Cliché galore	This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character's morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of "rich people watching" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular.
7	13 October 2021	luckyallstar	Decent show. Albeit somewhat overhyped and overrated.	After reading and seeing stories like Liar Game, Kaiji and multiple Battle Royale clones over 20 years ago this one doesn't bring anything new to the table. Not only isn't it the first, but Squid Game isn't even among the best of its kind.To be fair my main critique isn't the old concept. A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out. Definitely one of the best things about this show.
8	23 September 2021	tetraslash	A Must Watch Battle Royale-Esque Death Game Series	Loved this series and how it kept me hooked until the very end. The very last game and conclusion were rather mediocre and was a cheap method at opening up the doors to a Season 2, but everything up until that point were a clear 9/10.If you love competitive death game/escape room movies/shows, this is one you should not pass on.
1	1 October 2021	theactress00	Off putting	Could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. Extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... I kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. I do not understand what the hype is all about.
9	7 October 2021	Sharknun1	Deserved popularity	I knew this will be amazing on first look of it, I watched it as soon as it got out on netflix, it is briliant and it deseves all love that is getting.
3	13 October 2021	mypaperdue	Ending is so stupid.	Highly disappointed. The show started great but the ending is stupid as hell. I feels like I wasted my time watching this because so many things were left out. I am assuming there is another season into play but so far, I am giving it a solid three. I'll come back and change my review once they fix this crap.
5	5 October 2021	feelreallove-921-845971	Enjoyable to a point	Entertaining enough. The main character is super annoying. The end (explanation) is plain weak and goes ridiculously against human nature, therefore it weakens the premise of the 'games'.
5	9 October 2021	luceruc	Gruesome & basic - like its intended audience	Which I guess includes me; after all, I did watch all 8 1/2 episodes with no one exactly aiming a gun at my head. But I did fast-forward through the most ridiculous parts, so.Tragically enough, I sense a degree of genius involvement somewhere along the line, probably at the very start of the Squid project. A writer with a vision and actual talent, ordered by some meathead producer to make the whole thing as vile and watchable as, say, the first instalment of Saw, and the writer (whom in this case, also got to direct it) did it so his or her family could eat. Or at least that's the take I can live with. But anyway: don't even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid.
8	30 September 2021	kristinesklarz	Bravo Korea!! USA mom/wife is now a fan!	I thought this Season of Squid Game was done so well. So many emotions and characters to follow. I never thought of South Korea as coming out with something so good...such a pleasant surprise. I can't wait for Season 2 (perfect ending to a great Season-obviously there will be a 2nd Season).Great job-keep up the good work!!Anyone worried about it being in Korean-just watch in English and put English subtitles on. You'll never know the difference.
4	4 October 2021	Vinicius8	Funny Games	The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like "Squid Game" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don't want to spoil the series, I think it's more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it's unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that's where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, "Squid Game" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take "The Platform" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. "The Platform" doesn't dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn't matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our's and the movie's reality. Then how does "The Platform" differ from "Squid Game"? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in "Squid Game". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn't go the authors' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn't know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, "Squid Game" could've worked not unlike the aforementioned "The Platform", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as "Alice in Borderland". The realism wouldn't matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like "Saló or 120 days of Sodom". And it should've felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn't seem the point "Squid Game" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, "Squid Game" doesn't confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with "Funny Games". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don't worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question.
0	6 October 2021	jesusonasurfboard1	Scarily Accurate	I'm just gonna say this right off the bat, Ali deserves better. Period. That scene where Sangwoo betrayed him got me clutching my pearls and choking on air. I've never been one to watch K-series, and this series got me hooked! The acting is exceptional for all Korean characters EXCEPT the VIPs. What in the name of Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers was going on with their horrendous, cold, bleak acting?Aside from that, I appreciate how realistic and simple the plot is, but it is so well-developed. The one fact that hits hardest for me is the fact that if this game was to take place tomorrow, people would actually partake in it. Even more so, the same betrayals and back stabbing would happen too. Something chilling about that fact to me.
9	7 October 2021	carlhchristiansen	I if you saw this dubbed...	You haven't seen the series, so please don't rate...Saw this before all the hype, first day it came out, fell in love instantly.
8	18 September 2021	wolfzrain	WOW	DefinitelyThe director is a fan of Playstation.>.<
6	13 October 2021	ejh-60622	Not that good	Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I've already seen or heard of. It's a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.I'm not saying it's a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though.
7	1 October 2021	kalexalex	Stop westernising,stop creepy indian	Korean shows movies are the best no doubt...some are getting a bit too much Hollywood in em is getting scary...bit slow compared to Alice in borderlands...indian guy is making this ugly with overacting and bending down unnaturally as if he's gonna fall down... multiculturalism is ok but avoid these guys in good natural Korean shows and movies...they make it like Bollywood crap...rest is good.
10	4 October 2021	gordypix	Exceptional drama	This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series...
9	21 September 2021	amateurazantys	Everything Works	Everything works for me. The concept, the acting, the twist, the tone, the plot, everything.Superb.
9	8 October 2021	miroslavmilosevic-22770	Masterpiece	An absolute masterpiece of tv showThe actors the story the cast, music, just all is prefect, enjoyed every minute of it.
10	6 October 2021	alipowerdark	Excellent series	Make sure watch itits amazingif u wana more excellent korean series?I offer u thisflower of evilmy dangrus wifegoblin& hotel deluna.
9	5 October 2021	Polotovar	Original idea	There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.
8	11 October 2021	droopyn	Inconsistent but I had a nice time	There are a lot of holes in the plot...Many, maybe too many.But I had a nice time, which is the objective of entertainment.My grade:Acting (Korean style): 3/3Scenario (some flaws): 2/3Production (inconsistencies): 2/3No cancel culture, gay couples, or save the planet BS: 1/1.
9	2 October 2021	Harikl	Episode - 6 is the Best episode ever in TV shows History!	I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched. This episode is depressing, shocking, tender, furious, helpless, funny, intelligent and cunning. Unbelievably good and sick!Just this episode alone deserves an award for the team.Overall, it's a great series even though personally i didn't like the last 2 episodes.
7	29 September 2021	Herish	Suspenseful and exciting but a bit overrated	I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don't let the hype get to you.
9	13 October 2021	melcraig204	World Economic Forum Documentary	In this amazing documentary The World Economic Forum and it's sociopath members have lured "Climate Change" deniers and "vaccine" hesitant people into a deadly game of life and death. Will the people wake up and unite or are we all doomed to a future under the boot of the worst people on the planet...
2	17 October 2021	youssefmourid	way too boring and overrated !	The first 5 episodes are cool. Then the rest is sooooo boring , lonnnng and predictable. Dont let me start about the finale which is a mess and dosen't make sense.Thank god succession is coming back tonight, a real show with talent .
3	11 October 2021	arniewh	Bad acting and foolish composition	I just cannot grasp why people rate this over 5 points. Really. If it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic.
8	4 October 2021	Dolphchiarino123	Need A Strong Stomach	Let me begin by saying if you're squimish about blood and guts, do not watch this series. There's a good story line to follow but I found it a bit excessive when it came to blood but being a horror fan, I was able to deal with this part of the series. On the whole, the series is a study in human behavior especially under critical conditions and I'm sure this show will be a required study in all psychology classes. IMO, I feel as though the writers were paying homage to Stanley Kubrick and his portfolio of work. See if you can see the similarities as you get deeper into the story line. There are 9 episodes which last about an hour and one that's about 30 minutes long. There's been much talk about it on social media and that's given it a boost in viewership but all in all it kept my attention enough to see how it was going to end. I gave it an 8 since it drew me into watching the whole series....
10	18 September 2021	taneesha-66477	Must watch	This is definitely the most diverse drama I've watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.
10	28 September 2021	greengrl-80597	Perfect Originality	I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.
6	11 October 2021	hamadah-68360	Poor man's hunger games	It wasn't actually bad,but just like any netflix showIt's never good enough/greatIt's mostly an overhyped show that's (at best cases) A time killerSo scenes were really long that you don't lose anything by skipping a minute or twoSome actors were really really horribleEdgy and like anime charactersA bully is 24/7 a criminal/bullyA woman who uses people is 24/7 this wayAnd if there's a game that's based on people fighting to keep the bet on,why would they let them kill each other?And the whole brother murder thing is really dumb..and somr plots are dumb like a couple coming back again and being surprised they'll kill each other while it's supposed to happen at one point or the other,and people repeating that they'll get out together while the rule was you can't get out together and keep the money...and the VIPs arc was waaayyyy too dumb.
10	26 September 2021	degrees-33365	Visually and conceptually stunning	Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!
9	29 September 2021	milts-22133	Netflixs best series of 2021	What a show. Keeps you gripped all the way through. Brilliant concept, well acted (other than the VIPs) and you never get too connected to one character as they are all horrible so you don't get too upset when one dies like in other shows.
5	13 October 2021	redbythesea	Meh	Meh.Update when I finish but so far nothing really stands out for me or remotely exciting. Y'all are insane for this. What's all the racket about????
10	22 September 2021	The_Geek_Spot	Awesome..Loved it!	I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would.
7	29 September 2021	Mainecoon999	Great Visuals - Mediocre Writing	The story is far from original. You have seen it all back in Battle Royale, Hunger Games and maybe dozens of other kill to survive genre movies. However, this one has Korean Cinema stylishness, great cinematography, good directing and acting. Story and characters lack logic most of the time so just enjoy the colorful and gore world of Squid Game. Do not expect flawless story or deep social messages or grand philosophy because there is none.
7	26 September 2021	Mauseum	Solid	Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the "twist" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the "intruder" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?
10	28 September 2021	laurynl	NOT Your Typical K-Drama	If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don't get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one.
8	10 October 2021	Abumaor	Nothing like you've seen before	I've just finished watching this and I still need to process what is just went through. This show is very different than anything on TV these days.The script is very extreme and the story makes you think how would you act in such situations.I loved the characters.
6	8 October 2021	curiousbush	Cool concept but way too cheesy	The concept carries the film. It's really interesting, but unfortunately the player interactions are sooo cliche and corny. They're like the last seasons of the Walking Dead, for those that have seen them. The ending game especially was just so bad. They tried to establish ambiguity about the main character's ethos in the first episode, but it all goes out the window and he becomes just 100% angelic good guy, which is frustrating and annoying to watch.I still enjoyed it, I suppose, but with each episode I liked it less and less. It's fine to entertain yourself for a week but it isn't something to come back to.
10	9 October 2021	Js-bingewatcher	A well deserved 10 rating	This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece.
10	28 September 2021	nermina_teminovic	Amazing!	Wow so exiting and good! Loved it so much! Highly recommend it you wont regret it.
6	30 September 2021	bruninho-loopes	Weak	First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):What are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:The plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).
8	2 October 2021	d_welland	It's a whole lot of fun with prizes to be won	The Hunger Games meets Pat Sharps Fun House. Loved it and made me think about all those childhood games I played. As with most films that have been dubbed some of the characters are on the eccentric side, but that's something you have to expect.
6	19 September 2021	paulyew-45125	Atrocious translation	Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.
8	11 October 2021	tammyjune	Wanted to give it a 6...	...just because the violence, blood and gore were too gratuitous for my taste. But the story was so intriguing yet disturbing we just couldn't stop watching. Looking forward to Season 2 even though I'll hide my eyes for lots of it.
10	30 September 2021	movicus-63513	AMAZING!!	It was such an amazing show! I binge watched it and I hope they have a season 2. You sympathize with all the characters and you stay on the edge of your seat on every episode, and the performance of the actors that was amazing!
9	8 October 2021	platon_mp	Give me more	U got to give it to the Koreans. They know what art is and how to present it. I was hooked from beginning to end. A quite original production with lots of memorable scenes that we will remember for years to come. I cant give 10 stars because i disagree with the ending, but that doesnt change the fact that i stepped on a diamond.
1	11 October 2021	balchanderbhagwath	A a total waste of time	This is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. Don't want just waste of time.
7	8 October 2021	stephans-51855	Its a good show	I really dont know where the hype comes from. To me its aight, but not like wooowwww!!A lot of mistakes throughout the whole show, makes it unbelievable and sometimes pretty boring. It was okay to watch but not in a matter of you really should watch this show.
8	5 October 2021	neuhome	takeshi's castle with armed munitions	Great show with surprising end but with the fear of a second, everything destroying second season due to the open last part of the show.
8	25 September 2021	Allvgretto	Very entertaining though the ending lacked	I really liked the show, the beginning for me PERSONALLY was just a bit boring but I clung on and was attached to the show by the end of it. If you have watched the show, you'll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The "VIP's" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn't help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn't a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.
5	20 September 2021	kanifuker-84708	Not Bad but Not Great Either	It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.
7	15 October 2021	Dimakovtun	It's fine	In my opinion, "Squid Game" is overhyped, and I don't see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like "Cube". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.Do I think it's a bad show? No, it's decent and I don't regret watching it. Yet it's quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content..
10	29 September 2021	rminicoop	Brilliant.	I have to agree that the VIPs are the weakest point to the show, but they hardly ruin it. Don't let the criticism towards them stop you from watching what may be the best miniseries I've ever seen.I look forward to watching this again.
9	2 October 2021	costel8888	Daily life projection	The games ar nothing but a real life projection, "a democracy" based on rules made by capitalism, no one takes it seriously until you need money... you work with no limits and you never find happiness... try to look different into this movie and you will find the true message, true about rules in society, about democracy, and how people change themselves how money can change someone, overall great story, great idea.
7	18 October 2021	cristina-ro	Great show, terrible ending	I enjoyed the show up until the ending, I knew the premise of it before beginning it, its a hunger games and survival show. I wanted to know the why of it, it's the reason I decided to watch. I found it a bit violent, but it had great visuals, very colorful and actors where not bad either, I actually empathized with main characters and enjoyed the side stories. However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me.
2	14 October 2021	sergey-zotchev	Overacted and overrated	I tried, I really did. After reading so many positive reviews on the series, I gave it a try. Not just once...Overacting, seen mostly in Chinese kung-fu flicks, hit me after 15 minutes. So I quit. But not quite, since my kids loved the show, and I gave it another try, watching complete 1st episode and half of the 2nd one. That's when I could not stand it any longer. The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember. The point is: this crap of a series pretends to deliver some kind of message on greed, and people in need doing things they normally would never do... But it simply does not deliver, at least not to me. Been there, seen this somewhere.
9	4 October 2021	tthdOz18	At last!! Some refreshing new story lines!!	This is a masterful blend of elements of fantasy, psychological thriller, character development, personal journal- a refreshing example of superbly crafted storyline's. At last!! A decent , fresh program on Netflix!This Korean series is addictive, superbly cast, cleverly directed & beautifully production designed. The editing is gripping.The sound effects are nail biting. We loved it.5 stars to all the lead actors.Cannot wait for the series 2.But please, please, please- don't extend forever into series 6,7, 8...etc, etc, like some of the other substandard Hollywood shows that Netflix has commissioned before.
9	3 October 2021	karenblade	Think I'll have nightmares.	5 episodes in. Can't stand player 070, but boy is this dark. Sick and scary. I can believe this stuff really happens, for sick people's pleasure. A bit like Hostel, Saw and other scary stuff. Eye covering watching.
6	29 September 2021	ysndyrmn	Dissapointment	Scenario is okey,actings is okey and offcourse big budget netflix serie but deserves max to be 7 point who watches real good tv series fans. Just okey and nothing special and the worst part mostly when you watch netflix production you see only production in series not orijinal something.again exaggerated one more serie like la casa della papel.
7	3 October 2021	angeldwa	Will make you feel so many things	I don't know how to feel about this series, it left me with so many feelings. I have to say that I liked it for that reason. I was very uncomfortable watching the show, but something kept me watching. There were some plot holes that other people have mentioned already. I also think that some of the gruesomeness was a bit unnecessary. I understand that the gore was a big part in the whole show, but some of the scenes were a little too much. Otherwise, definitely worth a watch.
10	28 September 2021	atorresmercadeo	Season 2 PLEASE	A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience.
7	26 September 2021	bkgseoul	Saw on TikTok	Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean.
9	7 October 2021	azenyaan	Movies based on reality in life	This film is great, it deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. Apart from Squid games, there are many other survival games genre films, but what distinguishes Squid Game from other films of the same genre is that it departs from the real reality of human life. People in debt look for all kinds of ways to pay off their debts, even if they risk their lives. Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends. Money becomes meaningless and his life is not like it used to be.
9	8 October 2021	azenyaan	A film that departs from social reality	This film is amazing, deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. The selected players can portray the characters well, especially Kang Sae Byeok. There are many other films with the theme of survival games, but what distinguishes squid games from others is that it departs from the issue of social reality in society. Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless. This is what I think makes the Squid game very popular.
9	13 October 2021	katefrichardson	It's Disturbing...	That the top reviews on this site are because of the VIPs. Let's talk about the show itself.There's a reason this is about to be the number one most watched program on Netflix to date.Netflix has figured out that certain artists need to be recognized for their work... and this one does NOT disappoint.It's a beautiful story really... about life, death, and taxes. The three things that are true in life.It lays itself so deeply between its characters and you feel for each one as it goes along - the character development could be more, but it does the job just fine. It leaves you up to the imagination.The set design is also BRILLIANT.The idea that the games we play as children could be used by "they" to kill "us"... is groundbreaking.Hats off to everyone involved in this. It STRUCK me in the BEST way.
10	3 October 2021	bradleycarrington	Masterfully crafted Story about human nature and desperation	The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.
9	10 October 2021	laurentbauwin	Almost perfect	Battle Royale made the path so I can't give the 10 stars because that movie paved the way for this show.If you don't like thrillers sparkled with a bit of gore, you'd better pass, otherwise you're in for a great ride.It is very dark, the character development is well made. In 9 episodes you get attached to them.Don't listen to the people discussing the violence, you see worse in Hollywood but without the psychological scenario.There were plenty left for explanation but not in a frustrating way. More of I let the viewer decide. Great addition to the Netflic catalog allover.
9	3 October 2021	thomasafik	VIPs Guest Sucks	The whole series is tense in every game, as if you were playing for real there hahaha (if you get spoilers, it feels different). BUT ONLY ONE, EWW FOREIGNER VIP GUEST... THEIR ACT LIKE TRASH, SOO CRINGE. But it doesn't reduce the tension tho, hihihi. And in Korean dramas, there are always scenes that make you cry... prepare your tissues.
9	4 October 2021	grandempire1738	Flawed, but brilliant and suspenseful	OK yes, the VIP acting was atrociously bad and at the end it got a bit predictable. But other than that this is a masterfully crafted drama by filmmakers who damn well know how to create tension and suspense. I was worried that the "game" would turn into a gimmick, but it works so so so well! The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the "game" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP'sLooking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!
5	10 October 2021	Lilith_i	I really tried to like it as much as my friends...	The thing is, for me at least, I had to "forgive" much of the script, there are big plot holes in the series that one has to just overlook to make it to the end and give it such high ratings.Don't get me wrong, I get this is not supposed to be taken literally, and some suspension of disbelief is necessary for most syfy series, but you have to be consistent with your own premise.(Side note, sorry if there're mistakes/misspellings, somethings up with my app it seems.)
9	7 October 2021	Pruikhoofd	Absolutely loved it	I must say I started watching this because everyone is/was talking about it. So I went in expecting not very much, but I was wrong.This show blew me away by the amazing story and the incredible performance of the actors (minus the VIP's).It really strung me along till the very end and it didn't bore me a second.Amazing show, very different from anything I had seen before.Overall 9/10.
8	22 September 2021	francoisxavier35	Too bad it's produced by Netflix	I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men.
6	30 September 2021	starlit-3	Movie about humanity	About wolves and sheep in this world.Rich People playing God with the unfortunate and someone's version about right and wrong.Over emotional actors.Speculation on outcomes.I gave a 6 for effort and suspense held.I did predict the ending early in the movie but not sure how others faired.Stupid ending. What, oh a sequel? Meh, I'll pass.
6	4 October 2021	HallowedEve	Entertaining enough, probably would have been better as a movie	The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire "VIP" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?
4	4 October 2021	PedroRosRod	Very Entertaining BUT....	Folks, it IS entertaining!. However, taking into consideration everything that happens throughout the first sasn, the end is CRAP!If you're like me, someone who takes seriously how the story ends, this would turn into be a disaster!
9	27 September 2021	mehrdadjg	Predictable, but Awesome	So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.
10	7 October 2021	philosophyking87	Up There With Breaking Bad	This is one of the best shows I've watched. The production quality all around is superb. The directing, cinematography, the script, the overall writing, the cast, and above all, the acting. Every single detail was chosen to perfection. Even watching in English, it's amazingly well-developed. Full 10/10, one of the best shows in years. Go watch it!
8	25 September 2021	Holly02	Worth watching	The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2.
7	6 October 2021	Airman87	Should have been a 4 episode mini series... Slow at times.	A movie would have been way too short and required some serious character cuts, however 9 episodes was also too long. There were a lot of lull moments that either dragged or unnecessary side stories that contributed very little to the overall story and arc of the protagonists. Had this been sliced down into 4 or 5 episodes, the overall pacing would have been much better and created an overall more intense viewing experience to constantly kept viewers on edge. A little trimming and this would handily have been a solid 10/10 experience at how fervent and enrapturing the story moves.One thing also worth commenting is that Netflix indirectly spoils the final episode. On the parental guidance at the top of the screen, the 'suicide' word appears, ultimately revealing the outcome of the final game (even though it was rather predictable, it does confirm it).Not a bad series and worth watching, just do not watch all 9 episodes in a row or the story may move too slowly. It would be better with some time between episodes so you can build anticipation.
1	12 October 2021	basmeyer22	Inducing violence among kids	Therefore I vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it.
8	4 October 2021	e-jackson1985	Fantastic Show - just let down by 2 eps	Fantastically haunting soundtrack.Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.(SPOILER ALERT)X - episode 7 - the VIP's were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.X - red hair was pointlessX - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far.
1	20 September 2021	visionaforethought	How can this be a 15?	I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,
7	12 October 2021	Rich-91749	Starts weird, gets good but the end is poor	It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down.
4	6 October 2021	loozzotys	overrated & the ending S01E08 was stupid	Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie "As the Gods Will" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of "Escape Room" "The Cube" and the ultraviolence of "A clockwork Orange" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie's "Milk Bar" scene).Also the English subtitles are awful.The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming.
5	28 September 2021	tbasaurecastro	Ignore the multiple script holes	I understand its success, and I see that Netflix knows how to catch with a series (especially with such a remarkable visual production). But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section.
4	12 October 2021	mawallin	Could have been good!	Interesting concept but I just don't get why many of the (adult) characters in the Corean shows/movies I've seen act like one-dimensional, overdramatic, yelling twelve year olds? It makes it hard to take the story seriously and even more difficult to empathize with most of the characters.It's a cultural thing I guess but It's hard to get used to or appreciate.HoYeon Jung is an amazing actress though!
7	9 October 2021	Elie-A	Copy cat	Copy cat from Arena (2011)The story is senseless, i liked the authenticity in the Korean environment, more like a documentary for me than 'entertainment' because the sequence of events is just not plausible nor logical.
1	15 October 2021	ReviewingFilms	Should be banned.	Gratuitous violence. And we wonder why the world is in the state it is in. Trivializing atrocity by juxtaposing callous murder with cheerful music. Sick.
7	19 September 2021	Starlitelet	Great suspense throughout, but the ending was not worth it.	The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.
10	4 October 2021	mkay93	Best show I've watched all year	Wow! Amazing show worth watching for sure. Concept was so good. The VIPs doe.. their acting was weird. Other than that the whole show keeps you on the edge.. the characters were really well played and I can't wait for the next season.
9	7 October 2021	zemad-94176	A masterpiece	That's is the masterpiece of Netflix but the end is not very good so that I give it 9 star but if thay make another season that will be different.
10	6 October 2021	rosa-h-48039	A winner for me	This is in my top 10 shows for sure! Loved the acting the story, even the fan favourites will die so don't get to comfourtable watching this!
9	9 October 2021	hawkinsuhc	If not for the ending m, I would have given it a 19!	It took a minute to get started but once it did, I was hooked. With than being said, the winner pissed me off. He was so moral that he oozed of stupidity. Him winning was an insult to all those who fought and lost and died. He indulged in a year long, self absorbed pity party. Had I saw the ending first, I wouldn't have bothered watching any of it.
9	9 October 2021	BellaMyEmily	Binge watched it in a day	I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I committed a whole day in front of this show but it really caught me. Episode 6 had me bawling my eyes out. However, I feel like the last episode was a little disappointed. They tried to make you understand that you won't find happiness in money, but I just feel like the pace and the vibe were a bit off compared to the rest of the show. And such a shame to learn that the character whose "death" you mourned the most showed to be the evil guy all along.
5	14 October 2021	manolo-webmaster	It could've been much better!	I liked:1. The plot premise2. The costumes3. The setup4. The plotI disliked:1. The acting is over exaggerated2. Very minimal character development, the majority are unidimensional3. Laughable reactions from most characters4. Many scenes with screaming characters, can't they talk normally?
8	24 September 2021	dajsha	I recommend.	This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it.
5	2 October 2021	Danuvius01	Great idea, terrible execution	The story is great, but the acting is extremely bad. The dialogues between and durnig the games are totally meaningless.
1	2 October 2021	jim_w92viking	Utterly boring	Wanted to give up after episode oneManaged to force myself to watch episode 2My oh my what utter drivelWhat are these people give 9-10 scores smoking???Nothing happensThe main character is utterly unlikeableWorst series ever!!So dull.
6	5 October 2021	letthemkiss	Everyone say thank you Park Hae-soo	Even while deliberately turning my brain off some blunders were too glaring to ignore (namely the VIPs, who were an insult to the main cast). Even so, seeing the internet collectively enjoy and meme a piece of media makes me happy. You could also say I was in love with Sang-woo, so that contributes to my overall rating...
10	8 October 2021	chrisieridis	It's been a while.	Its been a while since the last time time stopped while watching a series. A long waited time.
9	14 October 2021	Shevy-Chan	Prepare to like an unlikable character.	Some of the best cinema I have ever seen originates from South Korea. They are masters at layering dubious qualities on their protagonists, which often makes the lead characters quite unpredictable, yet still very relatable.For too long Western cinema has followed the narrative that the 'good guy' has to be a 'nice guy'.... when in fact, the majority of us look out for our own self interests when push comes to shove.I feel like the writers left a few plot holes here and there.... but overall Squid Game was very entertaining. I gave it a 9/10 despite its shortcomings.
7	25 September 2021	barrywomb	Good nearly great show	This show is really good. A 'BIT' like a Korean 'Hunger Games'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start.
10	9 October 2021	michbissy-79037	Taskmaster meets Battle Royale meets The Purge	Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing. I love an open end that leaves you imagining your own conclusions. Well acted, good character development, heart breaking and whilst not entirely original it had enough going for it to make it stand out.
9	1 October 2021	jtrank-75214	A must watch kdrama!	The games and story is a crazy one. Surprised they pulled this off during covid but of course it's korean drama. They are at the top of their game. Very gorey, heads up.
10	6 October 2021	martinshh	One of the best TV series of 2021	I'm kind of blown away by this masterpiece. It does has it's flaws, mainly in the dubbing / subtitle area, but that's pretty common with asian movies. I guess it's next to impossible to do this 100% right. The series has awesome characters, not a single weak filler episode and many wtf moments. It's a fresh breeze in the world of Netflix' teenie action series that are basically unwatchable as soon as you are older than 25.
10	3 October 2021	sos_poseidon	Prepare to be anxious!	This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Prepare yourself, however, to be anxious and have your heart ripped out thanks to episode 6.
10	2 October 2021	levius-46895	Arguably the best show on nextflix	The Chinese/Korean actors and actresses are absolutely amazing! They make everything just feel so real and believable, yes the English voice acting is a bit off but please believe me when I say there are shows with MUUUCH worse voice acting. Watched the entire season in 1 day and WOW what a emotional Rollercoaster filled with thrills and connections to the characters! Awesome Awesome Awesome show.
8	11 October 2021	mehdiyama	Old idea but still gold	You play, you will die or win, it's easy.The main idea (( A match that everyone needs to survive from a life and death game)) is an old idea, but it still has a great potential for making great movies and series like this.I really enjoyed it when I was watching it. The actors played great, the music is stressful and great too, the main story and games are carefully selected.In my opinion everyone can watch this series and enjoy it, not for searching for little mistakes.
9	9 October 2021	bizzarebrajesh	Like you bet on horses or lower animals, there's someone who'll bet on you too.	Very well written and new concept with little flaws or missing scripts. But overally a very good show. The only thing I found that it's very slow.Shows every aspect of humans in a good fictional ways how each one betrays or kills or uses others for own survival. And the last episode where he tells how you bet on horses we on humans, shows the power of hierarchy. A very well written story as always I've seen other works of the director and he never disappoints badly.
8	9 October 2021	sdqftq	Overall pretty good, but the first 2 episodes, and last episode makes the show worse	I love this show. The series is very tense, with steaks being very high. It also has a lot of commentary on some of the toxicity in competition and discrimination. I loved this, but I have one major issue. 3 of the episodes aren't good, and this isn't the kind of series where you can skip over one episode and still be able to follow the story. I enjoyed this, but I'm not really going to watch it again.
0	12 October 2021	dougray30	I Guess Nobody Reads Books Any More?	All the praise for this "brilliant" series, full of "original" ideas. Go read The Long Walk and The Running Man by Richard Bachman (i.e. Stephen King). The Long Walk was the first novel he wrote (but not the first of his that was published)...it's over 50 years old, and was published over 40 years ago. Nearly everything this series is built on can be found there in a simpler format.
7	7 October 2021	Mazenabdo	Good show, not more.	While this is somehow entertaining, yet there are a lot of boring moments, especially, as stated in other reviews, the terrible acting by half of the total cast.This show suffers of the repetitive design of many aspects, such as the costume, music, places, even the reaction of the actors.Also, there is always a boring moment between the games, and that's while the games it self are not epic nor serious but some how they finish it with lots of blood and death...
2	16 October 2021	a-gordon-2374	Boring, horrible acting, predictable twists, trash main character	It gets one extra star for being somewhat creative at times. But otherwise I have no idea how anyone can stand this show.The main character is so awful and unlikable that it kind of ruins the show from the beginning. Why would we even care if he lives or dies? He's an unbelievably crap person. The acting is atrocious all around. Doesn't matter if you watch it in Korean or dubbed, it's forced like high schoolers trying out for the drama program.Plot twists? There are a few, but I had no trouble predicting them once the show gave you enough hints.The "Game" itself? Boring and drawn out.Couldn't finish the show but I heard the last episode sucks anyway.
7	28 September 2021	bachito1996	Predictible but enjoyable	Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?
8	28 September 2021	Nos2001	Oh the moral dilemmas!	With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!
7	14 October 2021	petdavies	Good but couldn't invest in characters	Concept is like a revival of battle royale (loosely) and very brutal. I was watching with an open jaw on episode 1. Slightly deteriorated a tad with each episode.I couldn't invest in any character enough to care. Don't make a second series and let this stand alone as a solid series itself. Like they should've done with a Handmaids Snail.
8	11 October 2021	greatcoder	A good watch	It is a very good show that once must watch. Best thing which I liked about the show is that this has ended in one season only. Other shows unnecessarily drags this to multiple seasons.
10	15 October 2021	kontakt-84639	Titanic for nine episodes.	I wish I could give it a 100 out of 10. It's a very well-thought-out series. Much is initially clear, but the intrigue was still there for me. Titanic for nine episodes.
10	14 October 2021	pandora-32182	Brutally brilliant	Im soo glad i watched this before all the hype started because shows are always ruined by hype and spoilers. Being completely new to korean telly, i was shockingly surprised by the story line, the drama, the acting, the cinematics and the entire shabang! Its the best series i have seen in a very very long time but i do feel it will be a one hit wonder. A season 2 just wont be able to match up to the buzz & excitement surrounding Season 1.
8	10 October 2021	dleeliberty	This show lives up to the hype	I was skeptical of the show since it had so much hype, but it was an amazing show by far. This show will keep you entertained almost the whole way through. The only part i wish wasn't in it was the vips they contributed nothing imo. Other than that this show was the bomb.
10	23 September 2021	sayantanroy-11186	Spine chilling game	I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.
3	12 October 2021	asterblasterth	I am confused...	I seriously don't know what the hype is all about. Is it because people get killed while playing a game? Is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? Because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better.To me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.
9	22 September 2021	amongthylacines	What Hollywood forgot	Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended.
7	26 September 2021	dummy-79	Good But 2 Episodes Too Long	Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean's. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3's innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing.
9	20 September 2021	vjmatinde	It will keep you guessing	An absolute thriller! The comedy gets you off guard even in the midst of a nail biting story! Enjoyed it.
7	17 October 2021	dennis-pishev	Depressing	I gave somehow high rating because this TV show brings something new/fresh. But I cannot say that I "like" it. No, I don't like it. It's boring in the beginning, then there's some highlights when games begin, and slowly it goes "the wrong direction". Often it's not convincing, not clear, and sometimes doesn't make much sense. I will not spoil here. Worth watching? I guess yes (if nothing better available), but I don't really look forward to the second season that I surely expect to come.
7	16 October 2021	linziaj	Don't watch dubbed version	Starting watching in English dubbed and found it to be more amusing than anything. Switched to Korean with subtitles after episode 2 and reading various stories of wrong translation being used. Decent watch but predictable outcome which makes the games less interesting (when you know x y or z is in the next episode) ok twist but frustrating ending. Spoiler alert- who let's a debt ridden drunk just walk away with a random kid who he then leaves with his aunt ?!?!
5	4 October 2021	RMBittner-777-930003	OTT Acting Spoils Intriguing Story	Maybe "Train to Busan" spoiled me with its naturalistic performances, but this series seems proud of characters that scream every line and act so over-the-top and hammy that it's ridiculous. I've sampled both the original Korean version as well as the English dubbed version, and both are equally guilty. Some of the leads are better than others, of course, but the hams overshadow them, making this feel oddly amateurish in places.
9	18 September 2021	seldomane	I enjoyed #Alive, but I love Squid Game.	Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!*To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*
10	5 October 2021	benwilliams1999	Wow...	I initially gave this a 9/10... then it was mid way through my 2nd rewatch of the show when it clicked... I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I've ever watched a live action foreign show. That's what clicked and made me give it 10/10.In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language. The show has it's flaws, but by far one of the best shows I've ever seen.
5	27 September 2021	kellen-couzens	Fizzles out mid way	STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.
6	26 September 2021	launrol_9200	Enjoyable and addictive but.....!	I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.
6	6 October 2021	alex_prusaczyk30	Could have been so much better	Maybe the main dude wasn't just so dumb and annoying, half the characters are hard to stand.
9	24 September 2021	katehart-60172	Give me subtitles!!!	Turned off on the preview - the VIPs were that bad.
10	26 September 2021	naifkhulaifi	Squid game best show in 2021?	First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.
8	18 October 2021	desiner1	Loved Squid Game!	Some of the characters were so annoying they made you root for them to die. Gi-Hun was one of the most annoying ones. Good action that kept the pace going.
8	29 September 2021	mrazovabarbora	I'm obsessed	I'm obsessed because its amazing show. However...sometimes it has a little weird 'feeling'. Somethings off. Maybe its the eng dabing, that make it 'overacted'. I wish I was fluent in Korean, I'd enjoy it more.. but dont get me wrong it was AMAZING. The first game, the marbles... I really cant wait for the second season..🦑
9	11 October 2021	randychenault	Best Series in a while	It would be completely unfair to rate the actors if you watch English dub, because a lot is lost in translation. This is the best drama series available. I.
9	18 September 2021	meramguru	What does Success mean to you	Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch.
8	5 October 2021	trapp_33	very nice show	Squid is a great show I will not write a long review but you need to watch it.
7	1 October 2021	qsspzhpzf	E1-E7	Episode 1 starts off a bit too slow but towards the end things get interesting. Episode 2 to 7 is amazing and provides something a bit different from what we've seen in the past year or so.Episode 8 and 9 are terrible, they don't make any sense! I really don't want to include too many spoilers in this review.Overall, we'll done to the main characters. The acting was amazing!!!!
10	30 September 2021	benjinightingale	VIP very inaccurate portrayal	Yea sorry alert from those ( who I think may have struggled due to language and culture barriers so nobody's fault really ) the series was one of the best things I've been seen . I'm pooped I watch it in two days and I need a holiday . I like to think I cry at things when it's needed but I'm either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I've ever witnessed from a show . I was a mess .... literal snot everywhere and sobbing noises which concluded at the end of the dining episode .. anyways I'm off to chill coz I'm shredded and need to be ok for a wedding this week. Bravo actors , writers , directors and everyone else it was a triumphal . Bravo.
6	10 October 2021	bougiadaa	Intresting BUT too violent	SQUID GAME is a series with a lot of common with HUNGER GAMESin other words it is like hunger game with more fantastic and weird challenges ..The thing that Iliked was the message that it offers''Money do not bring happiness'' and that people can kill their friend for the sake of moneyit has an intresting plot and actor's performances are good tooi was also burst into tears in ep 6BUT there are some disadvantages that should be taken into account ...such as there are tooo many violence scenes that should not exist in my opinion and some plotwist that i had already expected them .The issue with the policeman at the begging was intresting and i thought that he may help competitors to escape but he did not do something important to the plot , he could not to exist or be somehow different.Finally it has a weak ending .. it could be better .To my mind there are such a lot masterpiece of Korean industry and this one is not one of them but i reccomend to watch it only if you are 18+
10	30 September 2021	asdfqaz123	Only possible outside of Hollywood	This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers.
2	6 October 2021	comdinet	Standard netflix trash	The only good part of it is the music played before the game being, which is stolen from Hunger Games. Including the megaphone effect.
10	17 October 2021	Seasuzie	Unusual and violent series	I enjoyed this series. The acting was great even with subtitles! I was immediately drawn into this series and the characters. I really thought this was going to end a certain way but it did not. If you love horror and I guess Saw franchise this is up your alley too.
7	11 October 2021	iSeeMoView	Was set up to...FAIL	This series would deserve a solid 9, except for the fact that's it contains 3 pathetic and unacceptable flaws.As high-caliber that each episode and the storyline was, it went majorly downhill in Episode 7 with the portrayal of the VIPs. The show's portrayal of idiotic Americans takes the viewer right down to an uncomfortable level at how ridiculously these characters were expected to be. Even if they were attempting to make them seem stupid, it made the show pretty cringe-worthy from how well it had developed up until that point. It quickly went downhill at the introduction of these characters.Finally, the ending of the final "game" played in the show was really dumb and lacked redemption in the characters' development. As well as, the ending of the film and it's dialogue leading up to it.I was going to knock off 3 points for the above 3 mentioned failures, but wanted to be generous with a final rating if 7 (reduced from what could have been a 9, had they not messed up this show so badly). Overall, the show was excellent - until it was not - with its horrible conclusion.As good as this show was for most of it, the ending completely destroyed it, making me wonder "What was the point of watching this?" It is unbelievable that a show that was written and acted so well, turned into something sloppy at the end that could have been written much better. It's as if someone different who had no idea what the story was, wrote the final episode.I recommend watching it for 85% of the show. If you're not attached to having a properly explainable and redemptive ending, then you may love the whole thing.
10	16 October 2021	ishdeep-singh18	Giving it Straight 10 , Super content	Very gripping show and the characters have done a fab job..Very well stiched showLoved itCan't wait for S2.Totally new content.... Have never seen something ofnthis sort.Emotions...Actions...Thrill...
9	3 October 2021	mayankchandel7	ONE OF FINEST SHOW - Squid Game	OUTSTANDING...Well after knowing about the hype I decided to watch it on weekend and now I am empty, speechless.The performance from main lead was so satisfying and real, the concept was creative and allow imagination, this is what we called perfect mind-boggling cinema and episode 6 will going to stay there for a long long time....Must watch....
10	23 September 2021	mayank-s-dwivedi	A tale of human emotions, debt, and praiseworthy drama.	A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling.
7	10 October 2021	katharina-muellner	Not a new idea	An enjoyable watch, but personally I liked Alice in Borderland from last year better. Very similar idea, but more interesting games and characters.In squid game nothing really unexpected happened.And the dinner in the end reminded me very much of hunger games- which as well has more or less the same story.But all together still very solid an a 7 for me.
9	17 October 2021	riiircho	Nice plot	I liked it. Though I thought I'd hate the blood, it reminded me how I used to love to watch the Saw. It's not like the saw, but it's a great concept. And actually the scene that made me almost barf wasn't even blood but a naked man with the mask in the end. The concept it's great because it also shows how dependent people are on money.. these people felt worthless withiut money.. just sad.Now don't read my review if you don't want spoilers.I'm just sad that the cip didn't survive and you didn't even show where his body swam and what his boss thinks after that call. Just that made me give you star less.
6	27 September 2021	whiskeymovie	Could have been an 8 or 9	First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine "twist", but my God, his "explanation" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to "escape" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the "rules" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.
7	6 October 2021	ppde	Complete dark series. And no one would talk about it	Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless stateA recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think.
9	5 October 2021	maddyschiappa	Such a wild ride! Ending left me unsatisfied	Things I LOVED: the music, the cinematography, the writing, the story, the metaphors. It was really good!Things that I didn't love: the ending, the actors playing the VIPs (so bad in comparison to the main characters that it watered down the other actors' performances) and the hand feeding of things that we are supposed to remember. The fun is realizing you remember on your own!I still recommend watching obviously!
9	3 October 2021	labamboos	Never Let Perfect Get in the way of Great Cult Classic	This was a great reminder as to how concept can trump acting and writing. Even with some of the questionable choices of some performers, this show stands on its concept - which, though not new, is executed excellently. One of those that will likely be adapted for a western audience in the future. Solid watch, if you are not distracted by the more dodgy parts, and definitely better than a lot of other shows in the same genre at the moment. Cult classic methinks.
6	29 September 2021	tatjanabollen	Great untill episode 4	The show started of great, but after episode 4 it went downhill really fast. In the last episodes i was allmost confused if i was watching a Korean serie or a Mexican telenovel. Don't even get me started with rhe vips. And the agent looking for his brother was a bit to obvious for me who his brother turned out to be. As well as the old man and his death. A possible great show got crinchy and predictable the last episodes.
7	2 October 2021	nakeita-28697	A good show with plenty more potential	I went into the show with high expectations purely because of how hyped it has been in the media recently and honestly.. it's good. Not incredible like the media is playing it out to be but for its genre it's probably one of the best I've seen.I like the concept of this show, definitely reminds me of the hunger games.. all fighting over something with a common goal and everything just happens to fall in to place.. there's a lot of shows/movies like it but at the same time none quite like this one...Unlike most shows that fall in the same category I don't feel like this was too dragged out in anyway, everything had perfect timing and everything added to the plot nicely, it wasn't too repetitive and it continued to surprise me, it had many unexpected events that I honestly highly enjoyed.At first I wasn't quite sure how to feel about the ending.. a second season? Normally shows plummet when there is a forced second season but at the same time I'm glad there wasn't just some bland happy ending. Im excited to see how the second season pans out and I'll definitely be watching.
8	23 September 2021	Jinki-ache	Good show, but I prefer Alice in Borderland	I liked Squid Game, it's refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can't act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB.
4	5 October 2021	drparwar	Change the name, to Stupid Game!	I am not an amateur to be fooled by ratings, flashy reviews and mainstream opinion, I watch a series/movie with an unbiased mind and judge it accordingly, this was just trash, Ep1-3 were somehow good, but in a very ordinary way, after that, utmost piece of crap, completely overrated with hundreds of stupidity...What was with the last fighting scene? Three stabs, one to the leg, one to the stomach and another one right through his hand, and he is still standing and fighting, while one bite on the ankle, and the other guy is done, what the hell?The cop and his frontman brother, what was that about? Extremely irrelevant and added absolutely nothing to the story, just what was the whole point of it except just wasting time?And don't get me started with the VIP's, just duh....Long story short, watch the hunger games....
10	8 October 2021	crismarzavan	The greatest Netflix original	You already know how this show is. A masterpiece. 10/10.
10	16 October 2021	halderbijan	Best show ever	I am speechless..really Awesome show. Every character development is great.mindblowing web series. Best show of the year.we need second session of this series.
9	22 September 2021	spacekarma	positive surprise	Positive surprise, we know long ago that there is no more creative movies or shows from US, everything is just copy paste zero creativity. This show was so unique and strange I really enjoyed it. It starts really slow and I almost gave up on it. But once the first game starts the crazy stuff starts happening.. great work guys !P. S to Netflix Bring back Real PRIME STAR TREK YOU MORON. S ! I will unsubscribe!
7	11 October 2021	ajaykohli-46126	Decent watch	This show started with great screenplay and emotions , after watching first episode I didn't stop it excited to see, when the 5th game starts its totally collapsed and boring games it dragged to 9 episodes jst 8 episodes or enoughI were really disappointed with that poor finish literally I didn't like it started like horrible and ended like smoothBut it's a decent watch let's hope they can comeback in season 2 strong.
2	28 September 2021	RedfordJack	Immoral	The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don't waste your time.
9	9 October 2021	dirtydangles-04853	Very Hard to Not Like	I'm a huge movie person, very rarely do I watch series...... I binged this! I watched it with the English dub (this is something you forget about by episode 2), I don't care what you say, I enjoyed it just as much as I would subtitles. Great acting, awesome writing, very, very cool concept. I also don't buy the narrative everyone's barking about the bad VIP acting. They were likely casted to be unintelligent and rather elementary. This was actually cool to me because it made me think not everyone in power is smart and "scripted". This was the least of my concerns. Really enjoyed this one!
9	6 October 2021	walfordior	incredible show... but the VIP's...	I adored this show, the colour theme was absolutely phenomenal and so aesthetic YET terrifying, however... the VIP's could not act, but i'm not going to let the VIP's spoil the entire show.
10	2 October 2021	mesaaz-85537	Obsessed	Literally had to stand up from my coach and pace, it's so intense and very well done!
10	1 October 2021	GauravArora1977	One of the best web series	I m falling shortage of words. All i can say is it is 100/100 and a must watch for all thriller show lovers. All episodes are worth watching.
10	6 October 2021	RazielSHN	Best show of 2021	Top everything, go watch it, no seriously, this show was it for me.10/10.
9	23 September 2021	Sippyteacups	The best one of these in a long time ...	This is the best "Death Game" / "Battle Royal" type of show I've seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What's usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It's the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows "aliens" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That's not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that's really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there's a group of people that you'll encounter and they are horribly acted. You'll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future.
4	8 October 2021	Aura_Q	Overhyped	This seems to be popular only because of the recent hype around Korean pop. Good idea but poorly executed, the series has some flashes of brilliance but is overrall weighed down by the poor dramatization. Discussing the VIPs is a waste of time.
6	23 September 2021	sefafatjuln	The main concept is social exploitation, watch it and forget it	It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass.
6	26 September 2021	batoja	Not for kids...	The movie is allegorical to various ideas, from brutality of the people to that of the social, financial and political systems. From gaming the system, to playing the system, and being played by the system. Is all Korean in the representation of those ideas after that. After watching a couple of Old Boy(s) sort of movies, the thriller of plot turns and the display of certain characters seem too repetitive.Nevertheless, it is well-made. And it has the potential of becoming the best show worldwide if they iinternationalize it. There are kids' games in my country that have the potential of being far more brutal with the proper setting.Bit is atrociius writing this revuew in Android.
3	14 October 2021	nick-watson	Damp Squib	It is hard to understand how or why a show like this got the Green Light (pun intended). The only characters that seem believable, or even remotely interesting, are the ones that are NOT involved with the "game".If this is the #1 show on Netflix at the moment then I strongly suggest that someone test the water supply.
7	21 September 2021	donmega628	Different Alice in Borderland	Really enjoyed the series. Probably would have given it a 9...that ending though.
10	17 October 2021	salmanwill	No.1	It was an awesome series, multiple games, thrill, suspense, violence..Credit goes to cinematic editor.The old man story was awesome. It would be better if at the end there should be clip of daughter of main character ( Hero )
4	12 October 2021	rihard2000-396-581265	Wake Me Up When It's Over	Starts off interesting, but quickly becomes burdened with annoying characters and overly drawn out episodes. In the end I found it be completely boring.
4	15 October 2021	benashwin	Over hyped	I got caught in the gushing for this series so couldn't wait to watch it.Bitterly disappointed to be honest, so many plot holes that really distract from a good if not great premise.The ending is incredibly poor I won't say more as I don't want to spoil it for you but honestly don't get your hopes up.
7	13 October 2021	may197	It's OK, but Kung Fu Hustle was better	It's OK, there are some story-holes, which are probably in place because they want to make a second season. All in all it has an appealing (sometimes comic) korean movie aesthetic, but I liked Kung Fu Hustle (2004) much better.
8	1 October 2021	hambone-69699	Modern take on Das Capital	This creative new show, which has clearly been inspired by Karl Marx's genius work 'Das Capital', provides an up to date analysis of capitalism and its billions of victims.Hopefully it stays on track and doesn't fall victim to the very thing that it's critiquing.
10	7 October 2021	slowdive23-1	Ignore the Naysayers	It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix.
8	24 September 2021	jhonculada	Very bingeworthy!	What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.
10	18 October 2021	catrine-48845	Definitely worth a watch	Every time I started watching this I could not get into it. Today I decided to give it a try and I was completely hooked. The story was really good and I Watched the whole season in 2 days. There were some potholes, so I'm a little confused about Certain things but, overall it was really well done. Looking forward to another season.
7	8 October 2021	raypang	Overrated	Good show but really overhyped. I really thought it would be something special due to all those high praises, but it's nothing original. Gantz was superior. I guess some of the high rating is because some people only caught on how good Korean movies are, I'm not sure about TV series compared to US,( because of shows like Breaking Bad, Sopranos ) but for the last 10 years or so, Korean movies are much much better the rubbish that Hollywood have made.
6	11 October 2021	chughad	Brilliant work, but the last episode destroyed all build up	An amazing work of art, direction, script, production and screenplay. Completely engaging until the very last episode. However, the director and his aides made a terrible decision by ending it how it ends. The entire build up to the very last episode comes down crashing for me towards the end of it.It made me change my rating from 8/10 to 6/10.
8	27 September 2021	luckystar-59196	Not what it seems	Having watched all the episodes in a few days this was very enjoyable. Despite the games could've been a whole lot better (Takeshis castle type?) this had likeable and hateable characters to run through the story, some bits were slow paced and certain elements shouldn't have been there and used as a time filler but all in all was very enjoyable esp episode 6. Wish more stuff like this.
1	11 October 2021	victorson-1	What a complete waste of time	This is everything wrong with modern film-making. The whole thing lacks any logical sense, it drags on for way too long, the games are moronic and unimaginative, the characters are shallow, there is not even an attempt at creating some nuance and emotion, I would have more compassion watching chicken die than this absolutely ridiculous man-slaughter. The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste. If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though. It's literally that, nothing more.
9	12 October 2021	ReconMan8654	Those revolvers	...would have been more intimidating if their cylinders had been loaded!
10	25 September 2021	nmthomas-20486	A thrilling ride	This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films.
10	30 September 2021	dog-38563	Would be a 10 but....	Main character is completely unlikeable by the end of the story. Other than that the show is awesome with the games and side characters.
8	28 September 2021	cile-chan	SAE BYEOK... I WILL NEVER GET OVER	I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.
1	14 October 2021	punjabilion	Disturbing with no logic whatsoever.	Very disturbing with grotesque violence. Poor acting, poor story. Why that hell were the 'supposedly good guys' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, with all the grotesque violence and a poor ending. The main character only went back for the money, he knew in order to win others have to die. But now, he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings - you cant have it both ways mate!!!. Please save your time and life and don't bother watching this show.
5	4 October 2021	hammy-38359	Perhaps a good show ruined in translation?	Just read a review from a Korean speaker who says the translation of the dialogue is poor to say the least. That was one of biggest problems with this show. The English dialogue is awful. Painful.The acting is ok but there does tend to be a lot of stage, exaggerated acting in front of the camera. It is over the top. In particular from one of the central, female characters. The "baddie" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn't like the ending. Don't why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner's game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don't understand the hype.
7	8 October 2021	aronmartinvisser	Pretty good show!	It's a fun and engaging show. It kind of reminds me of Oldboy, but oldboy is a movie and better. I hated the VIPs and some plotholes annoyed me.
10	13 October 2021	clairemarie-06688	Fantastic watch!	Definitely watch this! After the first episode I was absolutely glued to the programme, I watched 5 episodes in one go, it was that good.Personally I preferred to watch it in the original language Korean with English subtitles, I believe it makes the programme much more believable.The American dubs were just awful.Fantastic acting by all. It has 2 brilliant twists at the end too!Enjoy!
10	3 October 2021	SamuelJan03	A Very Entertaining and Binge-able TV Series	This TV series is so good I think mainly because it is relatable. I believe anyone who watches this will unconsciously put themselves in the situation of the players in the game. One of the reason it is also relatable is because the personalities of each character is different, consequently their approach to the game. Apart from that, mostly the emotions from watching this series will make you engage at every moment making you hooked at it.
7	29 September 2021	Angerforz	Overall a great show!	Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.
8	4 October 2021	maitreyamulay	✨Something new concept Show✨ #Thrill, #Suspense, #Backround Score	Superb show if you watch till end. Because the suspense, that who is behind all that and why these games are happening, we understand.It's little bit slow series but we all have to watch this series above 18 ages.Wating for season 2......
2	3 October 2021	kzkybx	Not good	Conceptually interesting and visually engaging. Horrible plot where there is no background for most things. Subpar acting. The scenes of the actual games are fun, but other than that, nothing in this lazily executed series makes sense.
9	29 September 2021	mantilladn	Parasite meets hunger games	It's an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.
1	22 September 2021	muhdhelmie-13909	Exoectable, boring, Not worth your time	This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie.
7	5 October 2021	milart-08581	This was really cool	I wasn't experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know.....
8	22 September 2021	tgcme	A great K-drama debut	First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It.
10	24 September 2021	brendanhk	Brilliant	Very coolWay way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in BorderlandA must watch.
7	6 October 2021	jasonsgk	A little overhyped but decent	It's a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn't much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you're rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme. Like I said though, it's enjoyable, worth the watch but not as thoughtful as it tries so hard to be.
4	8 October 2021	menky2000	Very poor acting	Acting is so bad almost hard to believe these are some actors.My elementary and middle school kids saying everyone in school talks about it, so is this for soon to be teenage audience? No too much violence yet American kids are watching it like mcdonal of tv shows.
9	23 September 2021	summer_rain000	Yes, like it!	The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun factThe main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam.
0	13 October 2021	elia_b	the idea was interesting	Still I can't call it original and it kind of missed making a point. Left me with mixed thoughts about what was the author's purpose. And a second season?! Seriously? Definitely I will not watch another.
7	4 October 2021	shiversad	This show is best described as entertaining but not as deep as everyone is saying it is.	This show is probably the best example that popularity doesn't equate to quality as neither the premise nor the content is new it's just too many people are talking about it so it's very popular as there are many shows and movies like that, for ex: Alice in borderland, As in gods will and both are japanese and another japanese movie Battle Royale, also playing a survival game doesn't scream innovative as i went in with the hype just to be entertained and had no new experience.
1	7 October 2021	in-chaos-we-trust	A real stinker	Boring, predictable, a bad copy of hunger games, also a stinker, and Saw...kinda liked the first one... I think.The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that's impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.It's easily in the top 5 of the worst series I've ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at thatI prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining.
7	30 September 2021	Jap090	Great story	This show had a great story! I thought the game rooms were the best part and made show come alive. The only thing that was annoying was the voice/dubbed dialog. Also, really liked the characters. Season 2 should be more about the games cause main guy is definitely going back in.
4	7 October 2021	shahe-512-458330	Failed to meet my expectations	4stars. Hardly!I had high expectations before watching Squid Games... but it let me down.I am a fan of foreign and independent productions, never had the chance to watch from South Korea though.It starts off pretty well, but fails to keep the flame up with each following episode...No spoilers ahead!In my humble opinion, if I want to rate the series in different aspects it will be as follows - the points are over 10.1- Acting: mediocre - 22- Story line: too predictable and highly unnecessary scenes - 43- cinematography: nothing new - 34- Music : boring -25- Length: Horribly long and boring durations of episodes (my wife and I usually do not use our smart phones while we watch a series... unfortunately we were constantly checking our phones...) - 36- Concept: very nice and new but with bad execution - 57- Production: average - 58-Ending: it does not end... please roll the credits!!! But you still watch... hehe! - 2 (and the red hair was a total turn off)9- message: at least horses don't violently die in betting games.
8	17 September 2021	MostlyHorror	Love it	Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure.
2	21 September 2021	gotjee_arts	Glossy Fare For Torture Aficionados	There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.
9	7 October 2021	CarlosFacundoCornejo	I don't want to spoil you this great series	But the main takeaway from this series is never trust an old man. Besides that, there are lot of bad human habits exposed of course, and also unexpected situations that made this a solid nine for me, some things could have been better (i.e. The main character old friend is way too sadistic in most of the cases) but is truly a footage of the human being in the world.
7	5 October 2021	mjking1992	Good television that could have been great	A deeply poignant show that superbly builds its critique of our current economic system and the despair and utter desperation that it drives people to, particularly in the second episode. The acting is powerful and the characters also possess strong identities so you quickly come to see them as people.Unfortunately, the show peaks in the sixth episode, which was phenomenal and some of the best television I have seen. From then on, however, the quality declines, important subplots are left with no resolution, and the ending was erratic and dissatisfying: for example, it does not touch on previous themes of democracy and equality in the process.It feels as though the original script was heavily edited so as to allow a second season, and therefore make more money. Ironic in a critique of capitalism, but there you are.Overall, still worth watching.
8	3 October 2021	Mo9z	Good but..	Two points deducted for Ali and Sae Byeok. They deserved better. That's all.
0	25 September 2021	troelsy-833-316700	Wow, overdub has come a long way	It used to make me cringe. But I'm not gonna watch this in the original language. English is already my second language. Hating substitles was the reason i learnt English before school to begin with.
7	29 September 2021	Stan72317	Watchable but overrated.	Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie "Would you Rather". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work.
8	25 September 2021	rayal1950	Great show, very violent	This show is violent and there is a lot of death in it.But it is compelling and well shot.Don't speak Korean so I cannot comment on the translations or the voice acting of dub people.
10	27 September 2021	Roogatsby	there is no such thing as mine or yours gganbu	Hello English-ish friends!(Tl;dr: Skip the subs & switch to dubs.)This sensational series will probably appeal to you if you like cerebral, violent critiques of capitalism bolstered by strong character development (i.e. The Belko Experiment, the Cube films, Exam, Fermat's Room, or the Danganronpa video game series)...I watched the first episode in Korean but something is wrong with the translation in the subtitles. This became more apparent when I switched over to the English dub but left the subs on - the dub is much more nuanced, and the voice actors do a great job ad-libbing to match the characters mouths. Really excellent sound editing overall. If you don't watch a lot of anime or foreign dubs this might be a jarring experience (along with the English-speaking VIPs who are unfairly criticized in the reviews here) ..but I encourage you to stick with it becauseSquid Game is a lot of twisted fun!
7	16 October 2021	davewaldo-114-471767	Pretty good and pretty predictable.	I enjoyed Squid Game but feel it's rather overrated. I've been a big fan of far eastern and in particular Japanese and Korean movies for many years. Lady Vengeance and Oldboy in particular stuck with me. So many people have been talking about Squid Game, I was expecting a little bit more. When you know there are twists, even ones you don't expect, they don't really come as a surprise.
10	26 September 2021	michaelnicholasluciano	Best thing I have seen since I can remember	I haven't enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can't recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+
7	24 September 2021	thrillingarga	bit overrated	This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring.
9	20 September 2021	richcav-88934	Loved it!	Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.
4	7 October 2021	chefseanaz	Lackluster, a game that doesn't follow its own rules.	The first episode is absolutely ridiculous and enjoyable but this is so horribly filmed. People that are shot for red light greenlight didn't move and those that did didn't get shot. If your gonna make the game high stakes at least FILM the correct actors/extras.
4	23 September 2021	olaf-66694	Waste of time	Far too long for a plot that only stole some ideas from Cube or Saw. Poor acting and boring dialogues. Please avoid this one!
7	3 October 2021	allthevines	Great until the latter part of the season	The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I'll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming cliché and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though.
6	6 October 2021	joana98	very average	If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.Overall, 6/10.Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy.
6	22 September 2021	eleester	It was good...for a while	For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.
9	24 September 2021	paoloeuvrard	WOW. You have to watch this one!	I'm not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end.
9	4 October 2021	ammmy-13885	Captivating	Story keeps you captivating. Its little predictable but its great watch.
8	8 October 2021	marydanza	You would anything for money	"Squid Game" is certainly a metaphor of our time: in order to achieve financial independence people are ready to sell their soul to get it.The funny thing is that the winner is actually the only player who seems to have kept a system of human values. The meanness of each person looks concealed but as soon as the series picks up the pace it is irrefutably showed.The acting was authentic and believable but the so called plot twist could have hit harder.
9	1 October 2021	barn_se	Not for the faint of heart	Often tough to watch but a gripping series if you can see it out.
4	18 October 2021	souravpaul-70226	Overrated!!	I have watched far more superior series and movies than this one . I felt like I wasted Nine hours for just a little fun.I am not saying series totally bad or anything , just saying not deserve that much rating.Newbies may love this series but I watched a lots of series like this one..
7	5 October 2021	moviepiglet	Very entertaining show, but nothing spectacular	Yes the show was super entertaining and had you engrossed, and might even go on to become Netflix's most watched show, but for viewers who have seen enough cinema, there was nothing ground breaking here.The overall plot about rich people being bored so using poor people for entertainment - that's been done. The final revelation the old man gave was quite cliched.What was the point of the entire sub plot with the cop looking for his brother? He turns out to be the main guard, but so what? That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker. It was quite expected that the games were being funded by a crew of rich bored people for entertainment, but those actors and their dialogue gets a 0/10.Still, the show had great acting and fun characters, but the plot could have been WAY tighter.
5	7 October 2021	walterico	Gore fest	Whatever the many other virtues of this series, the violence and dwelling on blood and gore undermine it. I find it odd that squeamishness about showing physical love and nakedness can sit alongside a celebration of physical conflict, pain and injury.
0	30 September 2021	winchestertrista	Well done death game series	This show is very well done, the set design is absolutely stunning, the actors (main ones) are pretty good, the character development is great as well. Some great emotional moments throughout. Awesome practical effects as well. The only gripe I have with it is the addition of other certain characters (episode 7) that are just awfully done. Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It's extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion. Overall, it's a really good show and worth a watch 100%.
8	7 October 2021	beyzafififi	impressive, dramatic and traumatic!!	Although there were logic errors and nonsense, the series was very gripping and did not lose its grip by making it interesting until the end. It was a quality production in general, but the ending was so unnecessary and ridiculous. Despite its shortcomings, it is an impressive series with its characters, drama and reaction. Especially the first game, "red light, green light", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series. Also, the series has been the voice of people suffering from economic difficulties. The things I love about the show are the characters, the good portrayal of emotions in the scenes, and the beautiful creative plot. So i love this show in general, i can give from 7,5/10 to 8/10. By the way, those VIP guys acting were sucks dude, i felt so cringe when they talk.. but in general, they all were good actors and actresses i think.
8	4 October 2021	yes_jessica	Great show!	Although this serie is definitely not perfect I loved it! Interesting concept and loved the games. I would have rated this higher based on my favorite scenes: the first 3 games and the main characters were perfect! But some parts ruined a higher score: The VIPS were terrible, the story of the police officer did not add that much and I did not like the glass game. But overall: go watch this.
8	13 October 2021	redbullrex	The acting!	I binged it so currently I don't have much to say about it. I must watch it at least one more time. But as of right now I give this a 8/10. The acting was amazing. I didn't understand a single word but I could still feel everything they were saying, american actors can't come close to this type of acting so I highly recommend watching it in Korean. I tried the dubbed version for fun and it was horrible. It felt kinda rushed, really intense for the most part but then it had this sudden drop that lasted for one and a half hour and it dosen't leave a big impact on you afterwards. I don't know what they plan on doing in the future but I guess I'm just not used to TV shows being so rushed right away.
8	5 October 2021	ironfanwithvan	Super Surprise	This show came out of nowhere. With it´s death game premise I was hooked. I liked that the main charakter wasn´t imidetly likeable so we can follow his growth as a person over the show. With some fun twists in the games and between the show never feelt stale.
9	9 October 2021	kennethfchandra	9.5/10	Acting, Directing, Production Design, Score, Writing we're all phenomenal. I minus 0.5 because the VIP's sounds so textbook and cringe.
1	17 September 2021	MReddy_Nolan	Boring to the core. Waste of time	I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.
8	10 October 2021	Midget_1414	Decent show but too much hype	The show is decent although the 3 last episodes could've been better but I still enjoyed the action and the storyline.
8	10 October 2021	Midget_1414	Decent show but too much hype	This show was good better than most shows nowadays. The story in general was good with some nices twists near the end and left us with unanswered questions.
10	29 September 2021	diarkosophy	Yes, Yes and More Yes	I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed."Everyone is equal here" "You think money can fix everything"?
6	21 September 2021	rockyislolicon	Great start but dissapointed ending	First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.
9	18 September 2021	sky_wox	Great movie	Another game style type of movie from Korea.Great acting. Storyline good.The only reason I give it a 9 is because of it gets too many 10s one crazy rich guy out there might find it inspirational to start this type of game in real life.
10	5 October 2021	amar_lfc	All time classic . Unique !!!	What a tremendous watch . Riveting series . Wasn't expecting this at all . Ended up being an all time classic. The Koreans have nailed it yet again . Hats off to them . Korean drama is now fast becoming the best in the business. Flawless .
9	13 October 2021	JustS0meDude	Takashi's Castle with story and severe consequences	Really enjoyed this Korean series, It's like Takashi's Castle with a story and severe consequences full of gore, violent and twists and holds no punches which is what I've come to expect from Korean series/movies. The only only criticism is that the VIP's acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I've also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the "Hunger games" superior original.
5	26 September 2021	nathesnake	People pleasing, no innovation	The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc.
9	15 October 2021	chandansharma702	VIP spoiled but you atill want to see end...	Just read most of reviews. Most of users like VIPs, criticising last 3 episode and providing bad rating.Ok VIP's dialogues and acting are pathetic but you can not deny Squid Game has fantastic story with suspense and screenplay. So don't think like that and you should not provide rating below 7. It started well and middle of suspense also enough to stick with show.Those people who are expecting more then they just like VIPs and they don't have satisfaction and fun in their's life. Whatever you provide they always say 'no this is not enough'.Mark my word those users also want to organize kind of this game and find some fun ... ha ha ha.
10	2 October 2021	sidd275	An instant classic	Except for the VIPs acting and their embarrassing "jokes" - coughs *69,96* - Squid Game is one of the best shows ever being perfectly engaging and exciting.
10	23 September 2021	onlynay	Awesome!	This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D.
9	30 September 2021	mgurlgurl-890-846109	Amazing	This show is amazing, episode six was so great. Probably one of the best tv show episodes I have ever seen. But I kind of did not love the end of the show. It was kind of odd and not meaningful. The VIPs were not as annoying as people make them sound! They're a nuisance but it's tolerable.
10	20 September 2021	kristicako	Brilliant	An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...
4	7 October 2021	darealkash	Meh	They start stern about violence between each other, then that doesn't matter after the first couple episodes. It's a good show, but contradicting itself drops my rating.
7	3 October 2021	ronald-59	Could be a bit faster	Sometimes the story got a bit slow but you must keep watching! It is worth it.
7	8 October 2021	josechr	Worth your time	"Squid game" is a Korean mystery/thriller tv-series about a group of people selected to participate in a sinister game of survival.Every participant is selected because they are out of luck and in debt, and desperate enough to do what it takes to escape their fate in the outside world.We follow deadbeat dad and gambling addict Seong Gi-Hun, as he continue to fall into bottomless debt, and after a fateful late night gamble at the subway, gets an invitation to a final game where everything will change.What follows is a series of games, where the stakes are final if you lose, but the price is a chance to redeem yourself financially and for some, morally.The show is really nothing more, or less, than a solid script, with no forced finger pointing or animosity based on race or sex. There are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. Regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. There's no bigotry outside of that, which U. S. TV-shows are unable to write or make anymore.It's exciting, but there is a certain amount of over-acting and a bit of melodrama that can be somewhat grating to a western palate, but when the script is that good and engaging, it's easy enough to stomach. Other than the aforemented, the actors do a stellar job.It has some flaws of course. It's not groundbreaking or terribly original in it's constituant parts, but as a whole, it works perfectly fine for what it is.It's well shot, well paced, engaging, but with some overplaying that draws you out of the story a bit, as mentioned. Overall an enjoyable, exciting and somewhat gory and bloody good series, with added societal criticism and a message that doesn't label any specific demographic as inherently evil.
8	20 September 2021	vitnamee	Binge Worthy battle royale / hunger games in modern day Korea.	I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again.
4	10 October 2021	cooverknight	A fantasy story told many times before and with less obvious plot points.	I read a short story 'The Most Dangerous Game' in high school with basically the same plot, but not sci-fi with special effects. I found the Squid Game super boring and just about every plot point was predictable. I think the average Superman comic book has more interesting twists than this overblown, stretched out story. It was a disappointment since there are a lot of Asian movies and series that have really interesting stories with characters that are more complex than video game ones. But if you like video games, there's a good chance you will like this movie, except that you have no control over the story. Now, if the producers could get the audience involved in determining the fate of the games, that could be interesting. As it is, it's hardly worth spending time writing about it (unless you're getting paid) and I"m not.
10	19 September 2021	vietttttn	It's great!	Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.
9	9 October 2021	pawanjeet-83466	Amazing series	This series has many hidden clues. Korean series and movies never disappointed me they are full of humours and fats ONE SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS.🤐
10	3 October 2021	kuzu420	Masterpiece	Omg it was amazing! Attractive, interesting and exciting from the first episode! I LOVE IT! I love the whole characters and how they played their roles, it was damn sad when the grandpa have died and Sae-Byeok at the end.
0	26 September 2021	salmahassann	Smart and intriguing.	I really loved the show, it was absolutely nerve wrecking and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. Plot wise and cast wise its all good. I didn't really like the ending, i felt it was rushed a bit. As for the VIPs i really hated how they were portrayed. They're supposed to be the main reason for running the game but they're a bunch of old ridiculous perverts. This really annoyed me. Apart from this, i enjoyed it alot, waiting for season 2.
9	22 September 2021	ryanlhobson-99664	A more adult Alice in Borderland.	This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!
9	22 September 2021	ryanlhobson-99664	Better than Alice in Borderland.	This show has it all. The English dubbed version is a bit cheesy but it's acceptable. The show itself is gory so if that's not your thing don't watch. It is heart wrenching. I wasn't expecting this.
8	18 September 2021	zandraeriksssson	loved	I really enjoyed this tv show. It was a little slow sometimes but it was still good. I really hope for a season 2.
5	7 October 2021	Total_5_Destiny	I dont get the hype	This korean series is okay. It has pretty nice set designs and good cinematography. However the acting could definitely be stronger. The music is often pretty good, although some choices I personally found kinda odd. The story itself is nothing special and has been told in better and different ways.
6	26 September 2021	sebastblanco	Captivating and brutal with a critical message from society	A Korean series that shows a group of people who are put in a deadly game for money until one wins and manages to survive. We saw the story before but it has moments that are captivating, the message of social criticism is interesting. Obviously it's not perfect there are script conveniences, moments when the story is unnecessarily slowed down. It's worth it anyway.
7	14 October 2021	MsAce	VIPs from The Masked Singer Cannot Act	It's an interesting concept for sure. But the scene where the VIPs arrived looking like they were ready to perform in The Masked Singer is just so dumb.Plus rows of identical cars boarding a ferry at night seems like the kind of thing that would get flagged as suspicious.And the cop not calling for backup? Running directly in the line of sight of the rear view mirror. A game that has been going on for years and yet no security at the gates. Choosing to go at it alone. Risking it all for his 1 kidney brother. That's just senseless.Evading the armed troops in a labyrinth littered with cameras is also senseless.I felt like the revelation of the anarchy rule in the dorms was a bit rushed. A small guy attacking a thug with a freaking face tattoo while he was with his group of thugs is something that I do not see happening. Then the small guy dying so quickly.Given that you can just kill each other in the dorm, Deok-su could have killed Mi-nyeo with his bare hands but he didn't.Back to the VIPs. They are my main gripe. The awful script. Goodness gracious. I had to pause every few lines because it was just abysmal.I thought the painted naked people were unnecessary.All that aside I did enjoy the show overall. The games were simple yet creative. And I always love a good tug of war.I thought they did good by restarting the contest with those who chose to come back eyes wide open. You feel less for them since they chose their own destiny.The story was also insightful. The portrayal of gambling addiction. Predatory lending in South Korea. The concept of throwing good money at bad and going for broke. Chasing the ever elusive dream of winning big money. I also liked how they covered the topic of religious hypocrisy.I loved the characters they created.Massive spoilers below.It was obvious who the stronger guy was. He is also exponentially smarter. Yet somehow at the end he was a flailing idiot who could not anticipate obvious moves from the offensive and instead just attacking widly. Makes no sense.It was a bit too obvious who the finalists would be.And it was a bit obvious that the old man was in on it when they did not show his death. Tried a bit too hard to be poetic at the end.But Gi-hun coming out looking like freaking Party Poison at the end was hilarious.The fact that he took the kid and just gave him to the old woman was such a typical useless dad thing to do.Leaving his mother without a caretaker, is a typical useless son thing to do. Always with the grand noble intentions. Far too little, far too late.Then turning his back on his daughter, is really typical also.If you are a bad son, and a bad father, all the money in the world cannot change that. Just because you are not evil does not mean that you are a good person.
9	28 September 2021	benjermun	Best Show Of 2021	Genuinely interesting all the way through, it plays out like a living anime. All the characters are super fun to watch and everything feels genuine. There will definitely be a few things you can call a mile away but a lot more you could never tell, no doubt best thing Netflix has put out in years!
8	15 October 2021	Jane-doe66	This was a fun watch but i really don't know why this is hyped sooo much!	Dont get me wrong, it was a fun tv show to watch; i finished it in 2 days. The acting (particularly by Ju-Ryoung Kim and Lee Jung-jae) was very good. The actors who played the game participants did a very good job too. I really liked the cinematography; the way some scenes were shot really fascinated me (especially the bullet scene and the tug of war game)However i don't think it was a good idea to add the VIP members to the script, we didnt really get a background other than that they were rich, sick people who were apperantly, fans of these kind of twisted, underground game shows. They really weren't needed and the idea is not all that original either.I heard from people that it was like nothing i've ever seen before, however i really didn't find the plot original. Movies like saw, battle royal ,the hunger games and many other movies had the exact same plot so this show is really not that unique.Even though i do think this was a well produced tv show with good acting and an incredible cinematography, i think it is very overrated.
8	18 September 2021	saigan-82599	Koreans don't disappoint!	2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.
8	29 September 2021	balder777	Disturbing & brutal, but entertaining.	Deadbeats and losers being used in games that result in death for the entertainment of elite. Brutal, disturbing, and depressing look into human psyche. But good.Also, if you want something along the same lines, check out the anime "Kaiji". I believe there is some inspiration from Kaiji although Kaiji is more about gambling games (and is even more entertaining I'd say).
6	3 October 2021	asadullah-hannan	Overrated series	Good but not as much as people talk about it.Could be ended in lesser episodes.For me it's a overrated series. You won't miss a lot if you don't watch it.
10	7 October 2021	Umeshsonii	Highly Recommended	Awesome combination of Drama, suspense, thrill & A small demo of today's World.Must watch, its fictional but I'll give you some true life lessons, who is your friend, who is your enemy.
1	4 October 2021	johnsmithyo	Worst TV Show Ever	This is by far the Worst TV Show in the History. Congratulations, Netflix should win a prize for the most boring and the most poorly written snooze fest of a "show". I've heard that Netflix was bad but I didn't knew it was This bad. Boring. Yep everyone was right when they said #CancelNetflix.
7	20 September 2021	Bartlomiej_Lichwala	Good but predictable	I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately.
9	9 October 2021	VakonaWatcher	Amazing series, but the ending... was just stupid	The way the last episode did is similar to Game of Thrones' last few seasons. It was just a dumb ending. He could have boarded the plane and it would have ended right then there. And the hair colour..just wtf.
10	9 October 2021	purnankgreat	World bestest show ever	I think this is the best show ever made, if you are in confusion between stranger things and squid game, believe me squid game is best, my favourite series.
4	9 October 2021	rickeysmith-71027	Overrated	First episode was good second episode I played games on my phone while I watched. Will not watch again.
10	28 September 2021	PaulJosephWatson	Oh Korea, you've gone and done it now!	Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.
9	1 October 2021	brandonabrajano	Netflix has a winner	I love this show and the popularity is well-deserved. I was on the edge of my seat ever since the first game and it never let up, even in the outside world. Love all of the characters despite their cynicism and love each of the games and how original yet familiar they feel. There's also this lurking tension as to who will live, who will die, and who is behind all of this. Overall, worth your time and I understand if you don't like the final twists, but personally, it had me glued to the screen.
10	22 September 2021	tdipesh-31600	i mean woooh	After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.
8	2 October 2021	rtsdynamite	Early Second Season Syndrome	A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a 'normal' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the "thrill" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don't exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He'll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i'd support the devil's advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP's excluded), plot not as deep as you think.
10	19 September 2021	aabhasb	Well written..	Muat watch this series this is a gem well written and such a smooth script no boring scenes.
9	29 September 2021	rgriger-67254	Just shy of perfection	This is possibly one of the best things i've watched ina while, the only flaw about this show is that the VIP'S acting is actual VTT or at least it feels like it. It's not even acting it's just reading words, their acting is so un believably bad. Every other single aspect of this show is perfect.
3	2 October 2021	cameronwhiteboy	Should have been a movie	This show drags. I beg of you to skip episode two altogether.We're here to watch the people play the games and die. I don't care about all of these absolute whiny little girls and their annoying problems.I'll admit, I'm watching with English dubs. It's just like anime. It sounds over-acted and annoying. All the women in this show sounds beyond annoying.This show shines when it focuses on the games and the storytelling slightly before and after the games. Everything else is drawn out. I wonder if it's because it's a tv show. A movie would have gotten all of this out of the way and then play ball!There are some great diamonds hidden under an abundance of rocks. If you can hold out, then you can enjoy some great scenes. If you have zero patience though, do yourself a favour and hope they make a movie version.

8	18 October 2021	jc020899	Addictive and exciting	Exciting Korean Series.My expectations were exceeded binged the season in one day..... oops! Can't wait for season two.That a series on Netflix can have such a global impression.
9	26 September 2021	clintmoran	Battle Royale meets Lost	Awesome.VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible.
6	12 October 2021	RusOvidiuDan	I'm being genrous with the rating. Serie does not deserves more than 5.	Idea of the movie was ok, my problem is that the acting is so bad (like amateur level) that i could not get behind any of protagonists. If the serie would have ended after the first episode i could not care less. I'm not gonna watch any continuation of this series in the future.
8	1 October 2021	JimAsimenios	Interesting	I have mixed feelings about it. It was good but at the same time it was just OK. But, I did have a hard time stopping myself from watching just one more episode all the way to the last one. Will be interesting to see where it picks up where it left off. If it does, that is.
8	21 September 2021	bwgood77	The movie was pretty good, but the main character was maybe the stupidest character in the history of tv shows	Wow he seemed clueless. And selfish before the game, then somewhat unselfish during, unless it suited him. But it would have been nice to have a smarter lead character.
10	25 September 2021	psypup	Most amazing tv series ever made	Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!
9	19 September 2021	sihj95	Loved it	This whole thing worked very well for me. With the exception maybe for the VIP scenes (how were they so bad?). Otherwise I loved all the character growth/progression or degression in some aspects. And I was very entertained the whole 9 episodes, which I watched over 2 days!
10	16 October 2021	donaramu	Best show of the year, other than the last 10 mins	I won't give anything away, but the last 10 mins made no reasonable sense. It should have ended the way it started to after he right to the bank and not how it did after his haircut. Ep 6 is the first time is a long time I got sad watching a show. It was pretty shocking how I felt. Normally shows don't make me feel sad. But overall, I loved it. Great show. It took me a few times to try and watch the first 2 Eps, but I made it to the end. Enjoy!
10	20 September 2021	benimmyeo	Parasite + Alice in Borderland	One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2.
8	1 October 2021	twwarrior	Good show	I think it deserves my rating of 8/10. I think the main reason that I liked it was it made me care about the characters and what happens to them.Some things made no sense though. For example, why would 456 (and others) keep assuming that it's possible to win the game together with someone else? Everytime he was like "we're gonna get out together" I got confused as to why he thought more than 1 would survive.Another thing that I thought was stupid was at the end of the glass game, the girl (one of the last three) was injured by the glass shard. It just made no sense to me to do the exploding thing and potentially ruin the last game. But I guess they had to figure out a way to get rid of her so that the 2 men can have a 1 on 1.There's more weird things like that but I guess it doesn't make a huge difference to most people.Definitely worth a watch though.
10	30 September 2021	Deoster	Netflix hidden gem	Every little while a massive hit pops out out of nowhere on Netflix. Black mirror, Stranger things, etc. Squid Game is the new addition of those timeless masterpieces.
9	4 October 2021	mumair1558	Plays with Mind	It is a show based on Human Psychology, Emotions, Greed, Love, Respect and so many other things combined together. A brilliant story and a Must Watch.
6	13 October 2021	premal_15	Ending .....	Although this web series is indeed Superb i liked it very much but, I didn't like the ending part.But viewers should watch this adventure web series you will enjoy it tooI like all the characters especially the old Man he was very calm n emotional....Must watch ppl.
9	16 October 2021	citydogz45	Very Entertaining	This wasn't something that I would have picked on my own but when my boyfriend suggested it became something that I had trouble waiting for him. Dubbing takes a little to get use to but definitely worth watching.
6	14 October 2021	coeluracat	Not very Original	As per my title this isn't a very original idea. It's been done time and time again: Highlander (1986), Battle Royale (2000), The Hunger Games (2012), Animal World (2018) etc. The only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.I tried to watch this when it first appeared on Netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when I found something better to binge watch. After seeing all the hype about it I decided to give it another go, perhaps I should have given it 4 episodes? Nope it still didn't impress.I have to question the '111 million fans' claim by Netflix. I'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'Viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. Viewings do not correspond to fans.The acting is your usual frenetic Korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.The main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'There can be only one' (to quote Highlander) winner at the end of the game.My only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'Squid Game' and who the 'Frontman' was. The clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.I suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.I gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of Netflix's underwhelming prior offerings.
9	1 October 2021	sebastian-lim	The Hunger Games meet The Platform	First and foremost, a big round of applause for the director 👏👏👏 This is by far the darkest and most 'un-korean', edgiest Korean TV series I've watched to date.There isn't the typical sponsored usage of Samsungs, Mercedes, Subway, McDonald's or any of the big names that one would catch in a typical Korean TV series.It's grippingly leaves you at the edge of your seat craving for the next episode and the next.A must watch and absolutely loved the idea of the series.
10	3 October 2021	icaeducation7	Breathtaking	Must watch web series. Another entertaining non-English series enjoyed all through the episodes.
9	24 September 2021	paddymcrico	K-Drama that has shocked the West	This is the first Korean Series I have ever watched and I am glad I gave it ago.Lee Jung-jae (Seong Gi-hun #456) made this show for me. Given the fact he is the main character given the responsibility of capturing the audience during the initial introduction, he gave an amazing performance throughout the series.The show itself is a nice mix a gripponh dramatic thriller but with a slightly comedic element that wasn't forced. I liked the way you got a sense of background for each of the main characters. No doubt the costumes and symbolism is going to be iconic. So credit to Hwang Dong-hyuk for coming up with this concept.I think the performance of Anupam Tripathi (Abdul Ali #199) should also be commended. For a Korean Series to achieve such diversity in a show was great and he played his role to a tee.So all in all well played Korea and your spot at the top of many charts is quite an achievement. I gave it an IMDb 9, however really its a 10/10 from me.
1	5 October 2021	smickerr	Terrible	This show is absolutely terrible, and the acting is shockingly crap, it's like rewatching the old Monkey series.Pretty crap for this day and age.Crap characters and crap show.
1	15 October 2021	oocpaka	Pretty horrible	Laughable acting and hilarious dialogue(in an unintentionally bad way), add English dubbing to this and you get Squid Game.The over use of violence just makes it even more dumber, there is absolutely nothing realistic in this movie, even Purge made more sense.Not sure how this gets such high ratings, Ed Wood has made better movies.
10	25 September 2021	mryouh	What a gem!	Damn what I just watched. And.episode 6 just squeezed all the tears out from me.
10	4 October 2021	armyofrichard	Interesting overall & great acting	That one episode got me hooked in particular. I rarely binge watch the whole show but I did for this show. There is a reason it is such a mega hit worldwide.
10	22 September 2021	payre74	Game changer	Devastatingly perfect. This level of gorgeousness should not be possible. Shakespearean in stature. Prepare all your human emotions for a descent into the core of the human condition.
7	12 October 2021	Ben_Schwartz_	Binge Worthy	So hard to stop watching this crazy stupid show. Got to give it to the writers, it was so addictively captivating.Set design was so good you'll be seeing every halloween costume this year look the same.Episode 6 was by the far the peak of this series, an unbelievable conclusion to the previous 5 episodes. After that however, I can't say much... seemed to drift from the theme of fairness and equity among players which I really liked.Definitely recommend this series. Even though some of the mysteries that were trying to be sneaky were quite apparent early on, it didn't take away from the excitement and stakes of the game.(And something that I knew bothered many people was the atrocious acting by the American characters. Not sure if the problem was poor casting choices or some kind of language barrier, but damn, I can safely say for everyone- that part was hard to watch)
7	2 October 2021	travismancour	Is this the start of the Death Game popularity?	From some of the Manga Death games I've read Squid game is a decent port of the idea to the big screen done in this fashion. Sounds like its popular enough on Netflix that we will probably see copy cats soon (Maybe even a non-death version like Liars Game could be on the table now). As for the show itself I found it lacking in some parts, also didn't like most of the participants except the old man who was the standout. I found only about 2 of the games interesting.
10	10 October 2021	ehsan_irana	Copy of Saw + Hostel	This series is a good combination of Saw(1+2) + Hostel(1+2)You should watch these movies to believe me that this is a great copy.
8	19 September 2021	arjunkhatri	Well made, well explained worth every second of your time	It's really an awesome show, episodes are 1 hour or more long however you won't feel that time coz series never gets bore or slow, once you will start it you will finish it in one go. Watch it, it's really worth of your time.
8	26 September 2021	jbruce-39552	Episode 7 jumped the shark	Great series, but I agree with most other reviews. The VIPS were ridiculous.
2	1 October 2021	parhamardast	an other overrated	All netflix show is over rateoverrated and overrate.
9	9 October 2021	tanwarmanjeetsingh	Awesome	Korean content always blow my mind. It is totally different than what I have seen yet. Different story. Few episodes are little slow on story side, but will be satisfied after watching this series.
10	27 September 2021	drrahma_refaat	Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life.	Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life. I DONT think that I will ever watch a series so bingeworthy , so fun , so exciting ...Just Amazing.
5	1 October 2021	colinholmes-61171	Rubbish	Like the concept but the dubbing renders it ridiculous. Needs to be viewed in original language with subtitles. Otherwise it's just a joke. Shows how easy it is to please people nowadays if this is as popular as they say it is.
9	7 October 2021	contactjasonkohl	Perfect Amount of class and Gore	Those soundtracks made even the most awful games seem glamorous. Congrats to sound production! I'd highly recommend this new series. It's nothing you have definitely never seen before!
8	10 October 2021	Zeknight	not bad but must be finished i think	It is very good for Netflix actually their series generally cheap, poor quality and basic. But this is quality and unique. It look like time wasted.Story is like an anime. There is a fantasy world.I just want to say this i prediction that we will say after second season " i wish end in one season".
3	4 October 2021	dctatjer	Completely overhyped	The idea starts quite well (even though it is nothing new) but it becomes predictable after the 2nd episode and it contradicts itself quite often even though the premises are simple.I was expecting a mind-blowing series but it did not reach my expectations. Quite disappointing even though the acting by the "players" is really good and some scenes are have a surprising sceneray with a carefully chosen color palette.On top of that the ending does not make any sense whatsoever.
1	8 October 2021	vevelinka	I am sorry that this exists	Some sick mind created this..Unnecessary brutal piece of sh.t.
5	18 October 2021	gagegray-35480	Decent	I watched the whole season and though it was mediocre, I know a lot of people like it but I felt like some of the chapters were shallow and pretty much as a hole thought it was boring( I mean there might be some bias as I seen movies and some shows that are very similar)
9	7 October 2021	aumesh-10866	Unique and innovation at its best!	A series with completely unique n innovative script ever! Portrays all human emotions of helplessness, greed, competition, violence, deceit, struggle, guilt. A true master creation at its best!
9	3 October 2021	ostborgdaniel	Great show, But why did they do him like that?!	Great show overall. But I have to say something about II-Nam. I feel like they ruined the character II-nam by making him the one behind the whole thing... It destroyed everything of a character arc with him. And because of this it also ruins everything between II-nam and Gi-Hun in episode 6. Why did they make us care for the old man like that, only to completely destroy it in the finale?! :(
5	3 October 2021	moseslhpa	VIPS are super cringy	The show is at least 9/10 for me but the VIPs can't act at all. Their dialouge are super cringy and felt like they read it out from the script. Horrible acting from the VIPs ruined it for me.
10	14 October 2021	Syncroniam	#1 show, hands down...	I have no criticism of this show, whatsoever. This will probably remain the best show I have ever seen for years.People say Breaking Bad... I say Squid Game.
5	8 October 2021	raymondzesa-38659	Great start awefull end	As always, the show started awesome and ended in dissapointment.Its like this with all shows today.
10	30 September 2021	Alex_16July	Brilliant series	This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments. The series also reminds me of the movies called Hostel ( "the horror ones") but those films are like a concept if you watch Squid Game, it is like they copied your homework and made it 1000 times better.
4	13 October 2021	kowstoff	Predictable plot, and not original.	I don't get the hype for this show, honestly. It's very predictable, and it doesn't feel original. I just feel like I was watching one of the ''Saw'' movies. However, I like the idea behind the show in an apparent criticism of capitalism society and billionaires in general. It can be a very tough reality to confront, but this show portraits the bad side of capitalism in a very depressing and violent way, as it should be.On the other hand, it's not that hard to criticize capitalism, it's actually a very easy target. It's almost a trend these days, with all other TV shows and movies addressing this topic. I'm not saying it is bad to address this topic at all. I'm really glad this is being discussed, I just feel that this topic isn't enough to make this show original or surprising in any aspect. It's surely not a virtue of this show.Squid Game tries to build tension on violence and death, just like GOT did. But GOT's tension is genuine, well-built, and really unpredictable (unless you read the books). The tension here is almost useless, since we all know how this is going to end, and the characters death become almost trivial throughout the show. We know who will likely win and who won't. Sure, there are some surprises/plot twists along the way regarding the characters, but it's not that mind-blowing anyway.Violence scenes are excellent! It's raw, straightforward and merciless. I also liked the cliffhanger in the end. I like how the main character wasn't conformed with all the violent events, and how he evolved to a more mature and dangerous person.The first season of Squid Game didn't impress me, but there's room to improve in possible future seasons. This show needs another season, not only because of the cliffhanger, but the narrative needs a better outcome, and the main character deserves a better legacy.
8	28 September 2021	ahmedm0ustafa	Not bad for a Korean series.	As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to sayAnyways, it takes eight for all.
6	26 September 2021	rkbxsucnr	Solid 1st half, rest boring and predictable	The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off...
10	17 September 2021	yoshiduyen	Worthy binge!	This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres.
10	21 September 2021	sonjanovak	I haven't slept, couldn't stop watching!	Hands down maybe the best show I have ever seen, can't stop thinking about it!
7	3 October 2021	khuraym	Good but VIPs are	The show in itself is unique it's like a Last man standing type of game but in a korean way the worst thing about the show was the weird panther VIP hated him.
8	10 October 2021	JSophie157	A big surprise	I just finished watching this series and just loved it. I thought it was a series that would somehow disappoint me but as soon as I started watching it I couldn't stop.I liked the fact that it was a few episodes and that it didn't overly stretch the storyline. The colors, the scenography, the music and every single detail has become iconic.I found the acting of the various characters very beautiful.The series has managed to adapt to a more Western context, managing to make space around the world.
10	11 October 2021	himanijune	Very addictive, Different and amazing series!!	Its definitely a 10/10 series, amazing performance by all actors!! Waiting for season 2 eagerly.
8	28 September 2021	wendyyoungblood89	One word: good!	This series has a really good storyline.You think you know how an episode goes. But it always takes a different turn.It has been very well thought out.Well done and i would say check it out!
7	7 October 2021	iancestralpubg	a kaiji inspired film but not that bad	This is actually good i gotta admit but it feels like kaiji like in every way.
10	12 October 2021	harshg-32332	So dark	I didn't even watch any single Korean series or movie before this . This is the first time I watched any Korean series and this series is just mind-blowing .. literally hooked me up in every episode . The director did a fabulous job . And this show is too dark so be mentally prepared before watching this.
10	4 October 2021	nikku-86236	Binge watch worthy and gripping from ep 1	One of the best series by netflix , Korean worked very hard and rollercoaster ride for cinema lovers , it can beat money heist easily.
6	30 September 2021	angelarichardson-44685	Overrated	The games are somewhat interesting and the overall premise has some intrigue, but it lacks more than it gives. Poor acting, massive plot holes and a twist that's really average are ignored for mass carnage entertainment. I mean I get it - we all wanted to be entertained, even if it's poorly put together. The best kind of soup for the brain.
9	16 October 2021	sperare-30224	How did his phone not run out of battery?.....	Love this show. I've watched the series twice now but keep getting distracted by the officer's battery life on his phone. He was taking pictures and videos and making notes the whole time he was there and never ran out of battery...lol.
9	29 September 2021	maulcun	One of the best series i have every watched!	One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!
9	29 September 2021	hannaplokker	Best show i have seen in a while	I started watching this show with some doubts. But after just 30 minutes I was invested in the storyline and could not stop watching. I could certainly it's the best show I have watched in a while. Great original storyline and talented actors!
6	18 October 2021	Sheol1812	As banal as it gets	Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets.
1	9 October 2021	zippo8	NO ARTISTIC INTEGRITY SO LOSES ALL POINTS	Hey Hwang Dong-Hyuk you can't have it both ways!!This is the real world, this is real people being selected from the real world to enter a surreal world to play a game fabricated by real people who pay a lot of money to be entertained.The final demonstration of this unarguable truth is when 456 - a real flesh and blood human remember on planet earth - decides he is going to take a stand, be a whistleblower, and bring the whole grotesque vileness tumbling down.That's all fine BUT ...there is one episode where the real world crosses over into the surreal world of Squid Game, and that is when the VIPs come to town.This would have been a very difficult episode to pull off using "real people", think about that for a minute, the all too close to home, close up ugliness of it, so the director WIMPS OUT and we do not get "real people", we get an arm's length absurdist parody of the repulsive rich, a staged nonsense drawn from the director's imagination to replace that which was just too damned difficult to make real.Nuh! That's not ok.Hence so many people here complaining about the VIPS poor acting. But it not POOR ACTING that is the problem, the elephant in the room is the sleight of hand and dishonest depiction of the VIPS full stop.You can't do that, and maintain a unified aesthetic, artistic integrity.Make an MC Escher style world full of every kind of fantasy and excess by all means, knock yourself out, but don't ALSO bring the real world - the real world THAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SHOW inside and turn it into masked comedy.You'd have been better off keeping observers off the premises altogether, shadowy mysterious figures watching from afar via technology.THAT would have been REAL... and may I say, a lot more spooky.Overall, I'm truly amazed at the plaudits for this show, the raving, the buzz, the wow!!! The omggggs!!! The attention on SM....yes it is bingeable, it is easily addictive, and there are some great performances too, but I honestly think COVID has left the community desperate for distraction for people to be responding to this as they are.Bit sad really.Can only give this one star, because as the old saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
2	11 October 2021	weatherladykatie	Hard to like	I'm really not understanding why this show is so popular. I'm half way through and only one of the primary characters is likeable. The main guy gambled away his life, including his relationship with his daughter. The women are whiny and annoying. The "rivals" are your classic vicious bullies. The only character I'm really rooting for is the Pakistani. The story might be interesting if they weren't all in there because of their own bad choices, but I'm just having a hard time getting through this series.
9	17 October 2021	lulumary123	An insightful, heartbreaking exploration of the savagery of capitalism	Everyone is a pawn (or "horse in a race") in the game of capitalism, the pursuit of profit at the expense of all else. Squid Game is a grand allegory, told as if a fable by which children learn the fundamentals of right and wrong.There are no heroes here, everyone who plays the game is a victim, losing something essential to a fundamental of life: that happiness is not revealed in what you own or control, but in how much appreciation and concern one has for the world, for others, during one's short life.Yet even the 'good' people cannot escape the snap jaws of the capitalist world - those who benefit from it become twisted and inhumane exactly as much as those who are sucked dry to feed its insatiable thirst for more and more and more.Squid Game is fascinating, heartbreaking, never mawkish, preachy or trite - it reveals the animality of a system where only a very small few 'win', and even these winners bring nothing of actual value to the world. So everyone loses. And the moral seems to be, the players will change, but as long as the game exists, it will continue to be played.At one point the players are told that 'here everyone has an equal chance'. This summed it up for me - the two-edged sword, on the one hand a lie; that any beggar can become a king with hard work and the right connections, on the other - the truth - that we are all capable of the brutality, egotism and rabid self-interest required to gain enormous wealth.Watch it in the original Korean with subtitles on. The acting is superb and the English dub is awful.
1	15 October 2021	smittysays123	How is this rated so high? It's horrible	The characters are extremely unlikable the acting is absolutely a joke it's almost like a five year old wrote out the script and the dialogue. There is nothing likable about this show it's absolutely a joke I think people are giving it high ratings just to be annoying.
5	28 September 2021	saieash	Overrated and overhyped	It is an ok show nothing that great - typical netflix show.Feel free to watch it, but let the the high rating/reviews inflate your expectationsNearly everything was really predictable and the things that weren't were of no consequence.
8	16 October 2021	cedrix-23	Good But ...	I really enjoyed the serie overall,However the last episode was very very disappointing, The main character has done the opposite of anyone else would've done.
8	29 September 2021	askfxxx	VI-POS	Wonderful acting and great suspense, old wine on new bottles maybe, but tapped in a way that will surprise you all the time.Please watch it with the Korean voice acting and not the dubbed English, no matter your native tongue, it will give the show much more depth for you.I absolutely loved this series until the episode where the vip's came along and almost completely ruined it for me. Still good, but they took it down at least a few stars.
9	23 September 2021	eleni5	Hard harsh Horrific great movie	This is a hard movie to watch but something that could happen in real life too. Good acting by the main characters.
7	13 October 2021	network-561-589522	How fast can desperate humans turn into murderers?	The start and the idea were very promising: how far do desperate humans go to acquire money, how fast can "civilized" people become murderers only because they are told what to do: according to the rules of "the game".I especially like the idea that the players were perhaps just naïve and innocent in the beginning but then made a conscious decision to join the game and therefore accepting the rules. The victims become offenders.The series seems and is very brutal. But you can see many parallels to many war crimes that have happened over and over again in concentration camps, war prisons, purges.Unfortunately, the plot and the ending seem incomplete. Also the acting was not always good. And what happened to the translation and subtitles? Very often they say complete different things and sometimesthey don't make sense at all.I am not sure yet, if the series should end after season 1 or if it needs a conclusion.
8	4 October 2021	Ctherra	Was Stephen King first?	Stephen King would find this familiar...his story The Long Walk was published in 1979 when he wrote as Richard Bachman, about an annual walk for boys from Florida to New York(if I remember correctly) with a large monetary prize for the winner. Those who could not walk at the required pace...were shot.I like this show so far. I'm on episode 4. It is pretty well made and makes me want to watch the next "chapter" Could it be better? Yes, but the story is good and it's alright the way it is.
3	10 October 2021	hampton-overton	Predictable, cliche, overrated	I'm baffled by the high reviews as I couldn't get past the second episode. The first episode was so cliche in setting up the main character and his situation it was painful to watch. Nothing original, just the same story of a guy that is lazy, steals from his mom, gambles, is a terrible father. Okay, we get it, it's why he goes to play this game. They had a chance to actually use an original approach to this 'desperate failure' needs quick cash, but nope, this series isn't up to it. Then you have to buy into a lot of completely unbelievable situations and places. I found myself fast forwarding through the 'vote off the island' scene. I finally gave up when they started the mom is now in the hospital. This is a soap opera with blood. No more. It's not even funny.I don't recommend this to anyone.
5	2 October 2021	isefmert29	Overrated TV Show	It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that's been done countless times and sorry, this didn't sell it.
9	18 September 2021	marcy_surla	Nice!	Great series! Story, characters, setting, and mood was nice. Except for the actors who played the VIPs. That was terrible acting and it could have been better casted and directed. But all in all, season 1 was great!
9	22 September 2021	ejaysam	A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!	A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!No spoilers here because this is one to watch and explore for yourself!I'd just say this much that I watched this by chance and been watching for 6 hours straight!Definitely one to watch!
10	2 October 2021	xiaoxiao2007	Just amazing, I like these kind of movies in Korea	Just amazing, Korea movies has a kind of emotion express very strong of characters, not like US movies, usually less talking and less face's emotional, just like Parasite movie, also a good Korea movie, I really hope Korean can make more movies like this, very intense, drama and twist, which everybody loves it.
3	16 October 2021	paulytiph	Clever idea. Poorly executed. Just my opinion.	Overhyped, overrated and pretty boring for large chunks if I'm honest. A wildly inconsistent tone and It doesn't help that a vast majority of the main characters are utterly unlikable who you just want to see them perish. That's what 80's slasher films are for and they are usually done in 90 minutes and not dragged out over 9 hours.I'm super disappointed.
9	7 October 2021	shwetabrao	BINGEWORTHY !!	To me the highest point of this series was when it reaches the tug off war stage 😀simply superb !!
5	27 September 2021	Erikvsn2	It's worth a watch	I was expecting more from all the reviews. It's a good mid ground show. Nothing ground breaking but not bad either.
6	28 September 2021	chakibovic7	Overrated	First of all, that was one of the best designs I have ever seen in my life! The idea is great but there were many flaws, like the overdramatizing, overeating some characters are just don't know how to act! The VIP actors were terrible. You get bored in the middle episodes I don't understand the hype about this show.
3	17 October 2021	memnoch-13269	Nice ideas, but ...	The acting is over the top bad, especially one of the women is terrible, I fast forward whenever she has any lines, the plot is drawn out, I got bored after 3 episodes, I didn't cared for any of the characters or what happened to them, and why couldn't the guards see the cheaters in the honeycomb game? Maybe to push the plot forward? In conclusion nice ideas but bad execution.
9	13 October 2021	jpkaramanolis	At last something refreshing!	That's the best thing about streaming services. Without them we would never watch a series like that! This was my first Korean series I ever watched and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. Keep them coming on netflix! We need more countries to get the opportunity to show they can provide us with something worth watching! The show was great, the acting was amazing and unlike most battle royale types of shows i've seen, i actually cared for many characters! I loved it, i enjoyed every minute of it and i'm surely coming back at a possible second season.
6	5 October 2021	jcmoreno-07443	It´s good?Yes.Fantastic?Maybe not.	I have to say i have mixed feelings. I watched it with my wife, while we were also watching Sneaky Pete .We were doing it one episode from each one. My wife was grabbed by this one and wanted to saw the end, i was less enthusiastic about it.The plot is reasonable , the actors are good with a bit of overacting here and there ,the korean it´s a weird language and i saw it on korean with subtitles. I think this is more hyped because it came from Korea and people tend to find it exotic.Overall to me it´s a 6. For my wife i think she would give a 8 or 9.
10	14 October 2021	vickysantamaria	So Good!	One of the absolute best shows I've seen, possibly ever!I dont understand comments about the acting, the acting is great, except VIPsTotally deserves all the hype!
7	30 September 2021	daniel-65836	Strong start, poor finish	Very compelling opening episodes, but when the actual plot unravels it makes you go, "Oh, that's just it? That's kinda lame". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10.
7	12 October 2021	channellius	Strong start and middle but...	I've seen my fair share of survival genre shows and games, so I wasn't overly interested in watching this series, but since so many of my friends had seen it, I figured I'd give it a try. To my surprise, the first few episodes were quite compelling and the characters felt more 'human' and less two-dimensional than many other shows/movies/games I've seen in this genre.I think I was thoroughly enjoying this series up until I finished episode 6. Ep 6 was great, and emotional, but episode 7 onwards were just awful for me. Episode 7 in particular might've been the worst one. The challenge could hardly be called a 'game', and the VIP characters were unbelievably painful. I couldn't understand how the dialogue was so bad. The cuts to them and their cliche (and repetitive) dialogue made me lose that feeling of immersion I had with the other episodes. Episode 8 didn't feel like it really achieved anything, and episode 9... well, the 'twist' was quite unsatisfying. It didn't feel very believable, and there wasn't any closure with regard to the policeman and what he had attempted to send to the police when he got to the beach in the previous episode. It really just felt like there were some weird loose ends.So, I would give this show even a generous 10 stars for the first 6 eps, but I really was so disappointed by the subsequent three that I can only give it 7 stars.
8	1 October 2021	brennon_goodwin	Big Surprise hit of 2021	I saw this while scrolling on Netflix and noticed it was trending on Twitter & such so I checked it out not fully knowing what to expect. This show is crazy....in a good way! Although some of the concepts and choices here have somewhat been done before it doesn't matter because I've never had an experience before, like I did with this show. Anytime a show/ movie can offer that experience it deserves recognition. Still not sure how to feel about the ending but this is definitely an awesome series. Also I would recommend watching this with the Korean dialogue and English subtitles, it feels more natural and you can hear the real actors performance this way.
10	25 September 2021	herakc	Engaging and Original	Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.
9	27 September 2021	ftzfatema	Squid Game	(Contains mild spoiler)What an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that's the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn't answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I'll be waiting for.
10	2 October 2021	mehdiscott	Amazing	Held in suspense throughout, a furious desire to click on "next episode" as soon as it ends ... The atmosphere totally shifted between the cruelty of the games and the aesthetics of the naive and childish colored sets, as well as the very soundtrack. Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great actingThe ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much.
9	5 October 2021	jackelms	Probably the best Netflix show 😳	Warning do not watch the trailers do not read the reviewsJust watch don't spoil it for yourselfIt is a must watch seriesIn the beginning it was slow but as everything kicked off and started omg I was on the Edge of my seat non stop binge watched it all I had work the next morning at 2am I couldn't stop watching I had no sleep.So must effort put into making it!
10	9 October 2021	rishijaiswalsmart	BRILLIANT Web Series To Watch in 2021	Squid Games realisesThat even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .Billioner thinks common man are like horse to whom we can do gambling & make "FUN" by using them .Many ppl will do buttering/use you when they need something , but same ppl will throw you OUT they have same power in thier hands.
7	7 October 2021	npijlman	Anticlimactic thrill ride	This Korean show has great production value, a fun storyline, and some of the best AND worst acting possible. However thrilling its first half of the episodes may be, later on the show suffers from some bad pacing, acting and other irregularities. More importantly though, the show's big plot twist is already easily guessed after watching the first episode, which makes for an anticlimactic finale. Maybe a next season will tie up some of the many loose ends and will give some more depth to the otherwise rather shallow plot. All in all, it's a fun ride - however, not as good as the hype is letting you on!
7	11 October 2021	juanicuesta	Good show but not the best on TV	Good show, great 6th episode...but the best on TV history like some reviewers said??? Cmon, there is been a hype in the last years that people is saying the last TV show they just end watching is the GOAT. Those reviews are biasing the ratings on IMDB. It is Ok not to score 10 on a review.....
9	17 October 2021	pizzagoodgogo	Awesome show. Wish it was 100% in Korean.	The English parts of this show are just horrible. The vip acting is horrible. This should would be better if the vips were voiced over with Korean. The Korean actors had a better understanding of how English sounds...
9	30 September 2021	fayray-43736	Blood gore and social commentary	This k-horror is a must see. Lots of blood and death this tale is not for those with weak stomachs. But this tale delivers more than just shock value. It's a commentary on high stakes gambling where there is no risk greater than death. Children's games harken innocence while greed and sacrifice decide each players fate. The "VIP's" are the weakest link, depicted as caricatures of selfish rapacious greed; but even with their one dimensionality there is a lot of social commentary to consider.
1	18 October 2021	fabster-41320	Totally overrated!	The show does not live up to the hype.It's ok, but not as spectacular as the hype would indicate. I preferred alice in borderland over squid games. Now they are pushing for season 2, and I am guarantee you, season 2 gonna fail - big time! Mark my words.
8	7 October 2021	meessmeltekop	It's good but way overrated	I enjoyed watching the series but it's just way overrated.
10	11 October 2021	liamharro	Amazing	Absolutely amazing show. A must watch for people that can handle it. Episodes are always interesting.
7	12 October 2021	mdhatmustafa-92765	It was great... Until....	I came in with big expectations...and, yup it was worth the hype.. First half was amazing...the build-up was great.. It was an intense, emotional, heartbreaking ride.. I cried which is usually hard for me to do especially over a movie / series.... Everything was great until they reached their limit of creativity and trying...long story short... everything stopped being serious and authentic like before and from now on it was a drag until the end... Second half was so mediocre and underwhelming and sadly even poorly executed.. Didn't even have a realistic feel to it like the beginnings...I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time...
9	29 September 2021	rohanghalwadkar	Depressing Masterpiece	I think I haven't seen a more creative kdrama than squid game. And you can really see the hardwork and dedication the director has put into this great work of art.The characters, their motivations,cinematography, acting ,everything is top notch. Only complaint I would have would obiviously be VIPs but nonetheless best drama from korea till now.
10	7 October 2021	roodysader-75853	Great series but the vip !!!!	I loved everything about this show .. one of my best .. but the v.i.p acted so bad and made me out of the mood ..
6	25 September 2021	raffydibansa	Poor Choices	We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.
7	8 October 2021	rezakazemi2	NWO	Full of illuminati stuff, praising socialism, communism and even North Korea in occasions, Nothing unexpected from Netflix. The script is full of flaws and characters are raw and empty so badly. Good idea in general but another attempt by brainwashing machine of globalists to prepare everyone for apocalyptic New World order. A real embarrassment for south Korea by China-owned Netflix.
9	8 October 2021	islamsc1	What a drama!	It's was great untilThe last episodeit deserves 8 but let's give them a chance for now.
1	27 September 2021	juneb-20898	Nonsense series	It's nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you'll easily forget it in few seconds after.
1	22 September 2021	mertblackson	WHY? WHY PEOPLE LOVING THIS!!!!	Seriously don't watch this. You really don't want to waste your time watching this. It wasn't bad until the last episode, but they made the worst finale you've ever seen to get season 2. Trust me and don't watch.
8	9 October 2021	bharatatigerian	Deep meaning show with a lot of foreshadowing	Amazing writing. Amazing acting. Amazing music. Amazing concept. The main reason why we connect to the show is the human nature element. Can't say much. It's just a show which is really good with just 2 adult scenes in it (in case you are willing to watch it with your family). Don't miss this. This is not the best show but a really good show.
9	17 October 2021	dsgill-02652	Must watch.	A clear entertainer. Choice of actors is exceptional and everyone plays his/her part to perfection. Enough twists and turns to keep you involved throughout.Brilliant and honestly made series.
10	26 September 2021	paragkalothia	true story?	Super good cant believe this was based on a true story. We have to stop them.
8	4 October 2021	beclo-47737	Great show	I can't wait to forget about this show so I can watch it all over again. Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.
10	21 September 2021	jessicadroselynn	Masterpiece!!	For me is the best Kdrama in Netflix. So refreshing, thrilled, gore at the same time. Is really mind blowing. 2 thumbs up for this drama!
9	1 October 2021	nwbw-92973	What a series !	I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended.
10	3 October 2021	dilacrazy	Best netflix series	This is a best game series what i saw. I had a curiosity from first episode.
7	8 October 2021	sanfordchee	Childhood games with a deadly twist	Entertaining as K-dramas can be with clever plot twists and watchable characters. But really far fetched.
8	29 September 2021	roissetiawan-29015	Interesting	The Cinematography is good, not boring as a series.
10	9 October 2021	brosmkbros	Hwang Dong-hyuk did it right!!	Its amazing. Just stop reading reviews and start watching now.
7	23 September 2021	mamacosneil	Great series..... Until it isn't	Ep.2 & 6 are easily the top tier episodes. They built tension and characters right. It's a great story. Easily "A" tier series until..... The ending.YES, Great story telling, the tension and flow and ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO STICK THE LANDING RIGHT and it FAILED. Resulting into a dragging episode and an 8 episodes wasted. I also have to mention ep.4 " Rumble at night/ lights turn flashing" scene, it's a bad idea filming against the light or in a dark area, let alone filming with flashy lights (hahahah). It's an unspoken rule but important, I nearly puke and I didn't know what is going on at that scene. That scene is bad but not as TRASH as the ending. Still I enjoy the series but the ending makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6.

Also, "squid game" title doesn't fit the story. It's nothing about the squid game (it shows 1 scene and 1 game onyl) nor metaphorically they're the squid itself. "Child's play" is more fitting. The last 2 games loses the tension too. The last episode shouldn't exist. Its ambitious and throws away those invested scenes. The plot twist makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6. From an impressive realistic views to let's wrap it badly and make characters think illogically. Still, I enjoy the series (Just forget the last episode exist haha) And BTW, VIP's = CRINGE. The acting so bad I thought they're gonna be killed early by an illogical cop (lmao) but nope, they attempted to build something for a sequel INSTEAD OF A GREAT ENDING.
8	7 October 2021	be23zE	Great Fun but Don't Forget the Message	Squid Game: it's everywhere. It is almost inescapable at this point. There are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. I was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. Many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. And, to be honest, Squid Game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.This is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let's begin by getting my complaints out of the way. Firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but I understand why. Squid Game is a Netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of Harikari or Departures. This was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. Surprisingly, it's not that big of a deal. It works in a similar way to Disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and Mickey Mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.One example of the aforementioned pandering are the God awful flashbacks. When Gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the United States with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. I mean come on. How stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? We also have the front man's reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. I mean, I guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but I'm sure that Star Wars-Luke, I am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. But let's not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. I laughed my ass of during that scene.Which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn't detract much from the plot. Aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the M. Night Shyamalan "twists" can be seen coming a mile away.With that said, there's really not a lot to complain about here. Squid Game is addicting. I watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if I did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then I watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and I already want to watch the show again. Why? Two reasons: It is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and Easter eggs scattered throughout.So while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. The games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in Korea. Think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. They even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. This is a genius mechanism that I will get back to in a second. So the players are caged animals here. Behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. Don't you think some rich asshole funded this movie? The premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called "democratic" nations. We slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let's say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. We are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the VIPS.This brings me back to the voting system. The players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. We can't stop working or we will become homeless and die. But we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next Elon Musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love Elon Musk. They worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I got political. It's a touchy subject but it's true and Squid Game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.Anyway, I don't really need to recommend this show to anyone. You're most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like I did. Many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so I wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. It's obviously a great show and you will probably see it.
7	10 October 2021	JamesR1973	Excellent at the start, but disappointing finale	I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it's not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interestingHowever, once the VIP's arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the "acting" and dialogue of the VIP's was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn't properly resolvedWhilst the finale wasn't terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they'd done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the "reveal" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.It's a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch.
6	14 October 2021	hsaeed-07465	Don't get the hype	It had good moments till vip episode but overall games sucked and too childish and then the ending and last few episodes sucked..........................
9	9 October 2021	alrod312	Nothing wrong with the finale...	I read disappointment from many about the finale of the series. A more decisive finale would just have ended the story (and the series). This ending, instead leaves the door ajar for a continuation. I hope this happens.
8	29 September 2021	vincentvino	Better than expected	Better than expected. Dont wach the dubs. Original is way better. Sorry about the VIPs they are terrible. Other than that. Amazing until the last second.....
6	17 October 2021	domjan82	Entertaining but overrated and overhyped	Amazing cinematography, great idea, but I think it should've been a movie or a 5-episode mini-series. Definitely overhyped and overrated, at this moment it scores 8.2, same level as Money Heist which is clearly a much better show.It could be that English dubbing makes it less entertaining, but I also think that after the first 3-4 games writers have ran out of ideas.
7	12 October 2021	kiramh	Voice-over from Disney	All the dubbed English voice overs sound like they're doing voices for a Disney movie...badly. For people here who say it doesn't ruin it for them, I don't see how that's even possible. It's so comical it takes you out of the story completely.
7	13 October 2021	kiramh	Atrocious acting	The scene in the 3rd episode where the woman is screaming that she has to pee? I can't remember the last time I've seen acting so awful. Both the actress and the voice-over actor couldn't be more over-the-top. Almost gave up the whole thing right then.
7	13 October 2021	kiramh	Take back my bad review	Ok. Just watched ep 6 and I take back my 2 stars. Still only gave it 7 bc the voice overs still aren't good but you can see in their faces how wonderful the actual actors are in this.
9	4 October 2021	ayse_Cenikli	A little slow at times..	Did it entertain me? Yes. Was it new and exciting? Most definitely.Yeah, the VIP's were bad actors and so what. It doesn't matter it's still realllyyy good series.
9	30 September 2021	BloodyHellSunday	TO EVERYONE HATING ON THE VIPS	This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean languageI am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of thisThey are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audienceand this is why it feels kinda off to those peopleWe are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversationsThis is my theory I said what I saidLove this series and it's the best thing that's come off Netflix in a while so think for a minute and stop hating on this detail in an otherwise AWESOME show!
7	13 October 2021	cptgorn	Subtitles need to be more accurate and consistent	Had me hooked. A very compelling story well written and acted, but please provide more accurate and consistent subtitles- surely this should not be a difficult task?
3	15 October 2021	aamirameenkhan	Worst Climax	If the winning guy is feeling bad about his friends deaths why hasn't he helped their families for more than a year leaving them to live their miserable lives and they could've died by this time. It doesn't makes sense at all which is a crappy thinking by the director.
10	25 September 2021	Joey7034	Unbelievable!	So good I can't even describe it , story acting everything is soooooo goooood !
7	29 September 2021	bruno_vinicius1985	Interesting version of Hunger Games	I have to agree that the VIPs were the worst part of this show lolEven watching the show in Korean, you think they dubbed the VIP voices. Luckily for us they don't show their faces lol.
8	28 September 2021	krff	A disturbing emotional entertaining rollercoaster	Nostalgia. Reminded me of the 90s where I went through a phase of buying or renting every VHS tape that had a tartan label. From there I couldn't sleep for a while! This show is very good and will hook you in. However like other reviews it is slightly ruined by the cheezy B list VIP actors! It's like they ran out of actors late in the season and grabbed a few guys from a bar! Please take note of this for the next installment as it's an entertaining show.
9	6 October 2021	z-moses-z	I really loved the vip's	Squid game serie was shot in a perfect angles, not even a single frame was shot in a noticeable error, direction was marvelous, casting is well selected, and yes i really loved the vip's characters, what do you want a serious straight personalities? Who is going to watch this games must be sick, pervert, unbalanced and full of sins.. So please stopreviewing based on personal imagination. 9/10 first Korean serie ever watched.
1	8 October 2021	NicoleCorrin	People are confused	This is a horrible show. The idea could have merit but the extremes on everything from the over acting, language, bad translation, script, over the top on blood and gore made trying to watch painful. I have also heard a lot of kids are watching this - it is definitely not a family friendly show.
2	15 October 2021	nahian-zapador	It will turn you cruel , selfish and violent !	Acting is good no doubt but this thing will make you selfish and voilent . The man who wrote this story should be punished for writing such a plot . Human life exploitation at it's best .
10	4 October 2021	nihalbhat2	incredible and immersive!	Simply immersive. Thats my general consensus. I am only up to episode 4?(i am binging it so lost track) but this is almost meditative - the scope of this. The filmaking is on another level. Its so revolutionary, everything in it. Dont want to spoil it. Must watch..the acting is just superb and it will keep you guessing.The genre not to spoil is mystery/dystopia.
5	1 October 2021	malloh-e	yet another show to showcase the pure evil that is hidden in humans soul	I just dont understand the point ...ok, great showbut when you finish, you will just be in shock asking ..but why ?It's certainly not a fun show to watch an laugh ...not sending any message for society or being good wins after allthe lead character is great actor... and all other character were so fit.But really ...why this is no.1 watched in the world right now ?
4	11 October 2021	dwhitebread-888-13582	Stock characters, and predictable drama weaken a good social commentary	I appreciated the importance of Squid Game taking on the inequality and cruelty of Capitalism for the first half of this series. Then things got muddled. The plot becomes full of holes and dead ends. We find out that the only motivation for the Game was some bored, over-rich friends looking for fun, That's all. I was really expecting something original.Most of the characters never developed any subtlety. We are left with the Bully, the Greedy guy, the Crazy Lady, the Cool but Wise Young Women, the Clever Old Man, the Loser with a Heart of Gold, and a hundred Heartless Minions with no apparent backstory. And the VIPs were just comical.Squid Game cries out for a second season to explain all the lingering questions about the origins and motivation of the people who started and ran the Game. But I don't think I care enough about that to sit through another few hundred horribly cruel deaths again.
9	9 October 2021	niteshkrsrivastava	A Master Piece	It is a fantastic thriller series. First episode itself set the tone of the series and throughout the series I didn't have a dull moment. Now, I am eagerly waiting for its sequel.
6	6 October 2021	fadylove	Korean Actors nailed it.. outsiders spoiled it	Korean Actors are great. Every character played their role in excellence. Till episode 6 it's great. Later it's foolish.. showing capitalists people in stupid roles later on.. the Makers have some agenda in their mind.. Another Classic Series.. Ruined in later half..
9	17 October 2021	danibal555	Good show but fundamental flaw .. 3 people missing ;)	Episode 6 started with 40 people, - 1 doctor, it bring us to number 39!And was about couples.... 38 ÷2=19+1 crazy lady ...it give us total number 20!However,Season 7 ... was about 17 players only , 1 hanged its self, that brings Us to 16 players..those were crossing the bridge!3 people missing ! Not sure where :)
7	14 October 2021	masta_maze	OK and entertaining but not worth the hype	Don't believe the hype.Don't get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.I liked it. But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time.
1	10 October 2021	driverinteractive_st	The bar continues to sink for the easily amused	Low effort program basically designed to entertain simple people who like to watch people die. Not even remotely good, the bar continues to sink.
6	7 October 2021	acviper4	Good Thriller scenes , but way more predictable	Its good thriller scenes , make viewers want to what happened next . Action & acting are good. There is Hunger games or Death race vibes ,But however i feel its way more predictable. For a TV series fan i think it obvious that from the first scenes where the games introduced can predict its a death game or like when meeting Number 01 player it gets the vibe that he is involved.When they first leave the games that they obviously come back.Only scene that i didn't get a vibe before was last scene that he kill himself.Nevertheless good thriller considering its Korean.
6	8 October 2021	aussybearoh7	What....	..... The heck.... Did I just watch?Very interesting show. Extremely violent so if you're not into that type of thing I would not recommend!
5	7 October 2021	aliromario	Why is it so hyped?	Too many loose ends, ridiculous ending, not even B-level acting from the VIPs (special characters that show up later).Why colour your hair red? C'mon.
7	7 October 2021	olajkarattila	Very recommended one time watch series	I've just finished the last episode yesterday so I gave myself a day to recollect my thoughts.I don't want to write spoilers but as I see how big is the hype around it it's almost impossible to do so.If you haven't seen any movies with similar message then then you'll probably will give this one higher score for sure.I saw many and have to say that it is a solid 7/10The character build up starts okay. Later episodes mess up this with the so called VIP's characters are bad. Add bad acting too.The conversations are a bit plain.The storyline is too predictable but not bad.The settings and visuals are very good.The games are good too.The ending is very meh.So these are my thoughts without spoilers.(I watched it in English as I read about it is a slightly different then the Korean original)
9	28 September 2021	swarupcsc	Very entertaining and thrilling	Very unique storyline that entertain you each of episode and very much engaging. Each game that are featured is simple yet thrilling. You don't want to miss this one.
9	1 October 2021	ashleigh_samantha_hayles	So close to a 10! LOTS OF SPOILERS!	The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the "fairness" of the games?456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?His hair looked awful red. That is all.Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyoneHe abandoned his daughter AGAIN.He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking "chuck it in the water so they're thrown off" but no, he left it there and was easily found.Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only "disappeared" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!
6	29 September 2021	juttlaj	Slightly above average	Seen this story line a few times before. Pretty average to me. Reminds me of saw x hunger games. Didn't like the ending one bit and I'm failing to see what the moral of the story is. Definitely watchable and I did enjoy it just felt a little underwhelmed and disappointed at the end. I would love to see a US remake of this.
8	5 October 2021	iangbglass	Could have been a 10 without the vip acting	Wtf was the vip acting, i cringed so hard. Rest of the movie was amazing.
6	7 October 2021	webrover-31400	Don't give in to the hype	The only reason i clicked on the recommend for you was because I'd heard about Netflix being sued.This is a pure hype, social manipulation play.
1	12 October 2021	theano-88700	Boring boring boring	You have to be really bored to watch it. The point behind the plot is really interesting especially in our days, but I wouldn't recommend it. I regret the time spending watching it.
9	29 September 2021	Lokroep	Amazing show from Korea!	Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!
10	26 September 2021	sethrbingham	Captivating	I have never seen a "last man standing gets the money" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series.
9	4 October 2021	plentyofkissing	A bit of intense hunger games feel	Not often do I watch foreign films but sometimes there is a jem. This is one for sure. .Do yourself a favor dont dub it in with your language, hear and feel the real actor, his or her voice and emotions. The subtitles will come easily after the first 15 mins.. . I found the acting great..just ignore the VIPS part lol..that passes fairly quickly anyway..otherwise some you may become fond of, it causes emotions to rise and fall, there is mystery, suspense, some comedy, but mostly it holds you on the edge to what will be next. Who is who..and so forth. I enjoyed so much I went on the hunt for another Korean show..im now enjoying (not as good as Squid in my eyes)Sweet Home. Highly recommend Squid.
10	11 October 2021	yamenmclovin	Exhilarating	Been waiting for such a show with that much suspense.I loved movies that had similar storylines like Would you Rather & Saw.This is the cream of the crop.I am waiting for the sequel. I would hope for the games to be more complex though.
9	6 October 2021	callumganderson	Wasn't expecting anything and was surprised	I normally hate watching dubbed movies and tv but this was definitely worth it.I don't know if it's the story writing or the visuals but I was hooked after the 1st episode. Great show and even better if you go into it thinking the subtitles will annoy you.
8	9 October 2021	onur_xkhan	Great show excellent costumes horrible VIP acting!	If you are familiar wth 90s 20s movies, you probably watched not exactly but similar scripts in your life. But still it has nice twists. I have to underline the costume design especially masks. The masks were great but the Fromtman's mask is a-ma-zing! It looks neutral and wierd as emotionless mask of Joey Jordison if not better! Using gaming console button signs as ranking in whole script was also a nice touch.Finally i came here to mention the horrible acting of the VIPs and looks like I am not alone! If i was one of them I would ask my part to be removed after watching others in episode gganbu for example. Their acting is a documented proof that you cant hide bad acting behind a mask. If they didnt had a peak on their collegues performance during the shooting, they can watch Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven at least. It is a free lecture...
10	6 October 2021	ruhlandethan	Edge of your seat every episode!	So many twists and turns this show keeps you guessing every episode! It's an amazing show all the way through. Definitely deserves it's spot amongst the Netflix top 10.
4	13 October 2021	thebratz-91971	Boring	I only started watching this show after hearing / reading how good it supposedly is and I made it to episode 4 and gave up. I really didn't enjoy this at all and found it silly and boring. I won't be watching any more of it.
3	22 September 2021	barrys-2	Great set design, but not much else	I would give the set design for this series a "10." The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the "plot" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the "head man" and the cop. You know the last game will be the "squid game." There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop "disappears" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying "Be sure to watch Season 2."All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the "evil" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death."Squid Game" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and "Squid Game" is the umpteenth repetition of "The Most Dangerous Game" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. "Squid Game" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs.
10	11 October 2021	sarahlandsn	How can we multiply these filmmakers?	I watched this and thought, ohmigoshhh can this writer/director just keep going and going forever??? We need so much more in film and TV like this. Brilliant storytelling, cinematography, editing, everything. Bravo!!!!!!!
9	3 October 2021	mamoizelle	Squid Games plot holes are still bothering me	First of all, what a series ! It looks so realistic compared to Alice in Borderland or Hunger Games. The VIPs acting were so bad and so fake ruining the contestants realistic acting.Some plot holes that are bugging me.1. What happened to the VIP guy that went to a room with the police and got photo taken with his phone? Did he threaten the Front Man for this incident or sue the game maker ?2. Why keeping all paper files of the squid Games? Everything are digitalized and looks so hi-tech with scanner, surveillance, etc. It doesn't make sense3. The old guy is already 'dead' in the marble game when he took of the mask and talked to the Front Man to greet the VIPs for him (ep.7). And at the same moment he explained (ep.9) to the Front Man he wanted to be down there join the game because it's more fun.What happened to the police and his phone whether all the photos were sent, we still don't know whether he is still alive or dead. Looking forward to season 2 (if there is any)
6	30 September 2021	damsous	Typical overhyped netflix show	Not at all bad. But went down pretty fast. Horrible vips horrible end to the story. Very flawed but still interesting and intriguing.
9	2 October 2021	reazrahmanxd	I never thought I will end this series in one day	It's worth a watch but the VIPs were terrible in acting.
7	14 October 2021	kikessandoval	Amazing Story Lines, Bad Characters, Bad Ending	This is a very good and interesting show as you would see how it took over the Internet. The show is very creative its like if SAW and the olpyics and Korea came together to make a game. The story lines is very good a creative and original the show had somewhat good characters and the show still had some comedy in it and the gore is really awesome. But here is when it goes down when the VIPs arrive; they are rich men that are responsible for Squid Game. When they arrive to the Island is when the show starts to get bad. The side plot with the police officer trying to find his brother was good up until the. The boss of the Squid Game is the policeman brother and he kills him, that was pretty stupid and pointless to have him die just to find out his brother was running the game at that time. The characters are really good and some are pretty funny but the writers in some of the games decided to screw them off and kill them off. The ending was probably the worst ending ever, the ending leaves off with 2 people left and they have to fight to the death in a game of Squid Game an old Korean hopscotch type game. And the ending where it leaves the last main character going to head to Los Angeles and not deciding but just staying and stopping Squid Game was kinda dumb.
10	3 October 2021	habibjedly	Great work	This series is a purely television masterpiece, as it presented us with a new and completely unrepetitive idea and this is what made us enjoy in every episode because we see things that we are not used to seeing much, in addition to that it discussed many important issues such as the accumulation of debts on humans, as well as equality between Individuals and other issues. And in the end I put it back again This work is a purely television masterpiece.
6	16 October 2021	braids-10242	Adult game for the not so faint hearted!	Listen, having my eardrums busted with the hype surrounding this show I thought I'd give it a go! Authentic yes but there's only so much bloodshed before it becomes a bore. If you've got a few hours to kill give it a shot, overrated, would not be in my top 20 series - box sets!
10	17 October 2021	robertomedem	Great show, terrible ending	The show is surprisingly good, but you need to watch it in Korean. The end is really bad, is a perfect show to discover Korean films/shows but the end is trash.
8	14 October 2021	hettichsjulian	Well made show but...	First the VIP acting was hilariousSecond Netflix typical this show does not end after one season (at least it's clearly implied), even tho it clearly should or could have ended. I can't stand it when great concepts are ruined like that!
10	1 October 2021	bs-22489	bloody series	..but entertained from the very beginning until end of season 1.Interesting story, great act (except of the crazy woman and the VIP's - really annoying)However I've enjoyed each episode!
1	16 October 2021	devanshjain-90767	Bloody	No matter how the direction of this show is but it's not at all good to villify the life so casually.(In the last episode they are trying to justify it too.) Wrote this because review was short.
1	4 October 2021	s-29175	fully time waste predictable story if thia web was release on 2015 or 2016 then i must hail it	Terefic irrelevent boring irritatingi am watching this show from last 12 days and finally today i end this seriesgenrally i play vedios on normal speed but for this i want 2x to 4x speed and finally i completed this show with infinite suffering thanks to my patience level one last thing i goona say about this web is increase my patience level.
10	26 September 2021	kflynn-24551	One of the best shows I've seen in a while.	Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend.
8	4 October 2021	atulyanidhi	Modern take on The Hunger Games	It's a survival webseries. It is gripping to watch. You cud predict some plots but still it is interesting and keep you hooked.Definitely worth a watch. Picturisation is good, direction too.
1	7 October 2021	maziyarsoroush	Nothing new, nothing worthy...	1. The Plot: We have seen it so many times. In "Saw", "Hunger Games", "EscapeRoom", "13" & etc.2. The Games: They are not thrilling or exciting, just a bunch of childish games. Even sometimes they get really boring, like the marble mission.3. Ending: Pure trash and total cliché. "WE ARE RICH AND WE ENTERTAIN OURSELVES BY PLAYING CRUEL GAMES WITH PEOPLE" !!! C'mon dudes! That same old crap again??? How many times we have to see this???Total disappointment.
4	20 September 2021	pjryan-49812	Zzzzzzz	I'm so boreddddd. I'm on ep 3 or 4 and there's Only been one game what the heck? Lol. Hunger games was more riveting.
9	7 October 2021	fanaf-96285	It is "only" 9 because	I knew who is who by the 3-4. Episode, but good characters and story. Exciting, thrilling, brutal, sensitive.
10	11 October 2021	lvstuntrider	Top series of 2021	Must watch. In my personal opinion this is one of the best series I have watched. It takes you breathless from start to the end. Every episode is a trill and enjoyment. I wish american series are like this, but unfortunately most of them these days try to milk it to the end and spoil everything they make. I am so glad that someone actually rise above Hollywood. It was about time !!!
8	30 September 2021	v4oF	Good. not the best	Damn it's so good. But it's not the best 😕I loved 067 and her friend mostcuz they're cute 😍and it contains a lot of violence so its not recommended for family.
3	5 October 2021	geddzik	Games are interesting the show itself is meh.	Acting is horrible and you can fast forward through half of it and still understand what's going on. Some of the games are interesting. Some take forever for no reason.
8	28 September 2021	scharhon	First Korean programme I loved	The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.
1	10 October 2021	bhattaraiprabin	Overrated af	Idk why there is so much hype about this series. There is only thrill in one episode where they have to cross bridge made of glass. Thats it. No any thrill , slept 3 times between episode 1-4.. restarted again and finished after 4th attempts.
5	17 October 2021	TobBec210	Absolutely overrated	A series that makes use of the deepest abysses of humanity to arouse interest, in itself ethically reprehensible but fundamentally for this reason to rate the series poorly is not correct. Because there are many titles with similar if not more violence. Nevertheless, just for the reason that there are many such titles with better actors and story, this series is not a milestone, not even something special. Also the presentation is not special. The series thus clearly serves the average, but basically this would still justify a rating of 6 stars. However, this is not a series that needed a continuation, it should have received a clear conclusion and the basic attempt to make the games more than they are fails grandiosely from my perspective.Nevertheless, the majority of the deductions of stars comes to 5, for the reason of comparing the series with others that offers a comparatively same setting. By this fact that the series here only the average reproduces it falls in comparison even further behind and receives the from my point of view certainly strict but deliberately chosen 5 stars.
6	10 October 2021	BrokenDarkness	Great idea, bad execution	The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn't suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn't written well enough and haven't got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he's on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode "Gganbu" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you're okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that's not really any kind of masterpiece.
10	4 October 2021	dipanshusahu-10675	Best Korean Series but VIPs Ruined it..	I just imagined this type of game in my mind only but never thought it will become real in series. And this series plays so much with our feelings for example - we want both players alive but one has to die and it hurts so much. I loved and enjoyed this series so much but the last three episodes were hurtful. And VIPs ruined it because of what shitty acting had done the VIPs. I am happy with the ending because Season 2 of Squid games will be coming soon next year.
9	1 October 2021	saravalgimigli	W*f!	WowIt's a beautiful series, i think that there were nothig like that on netflix for a long time.I think that is in with korean style, strange, twisted and psychological ahah.Maybe some scenes is a little bit predictable but i really loved this serie, i trully suggest it!!
10	25 September 2021	rohitt-68197	It's awesome	Honestly I'm good reviewer.. this series is great go and watch.
9	9 October 2021	dpickles-56507	Brilliant but Not Perfect	This show seems simple at first, but later expands what makes it great. With endearing characters, story, and an interesting take on human nature. Showing what anyone would do for money. However, like a lot of dubs, there is a bit on uncoordinated lips. But that can be expected.
7	25 September 2021	vonipsc	Stupid idea for rich	Why giving rich people stupid ideas? Acting is so good, actors are very honest and Koreans are so beautiful, but the VIPs... it is so bad. Love for Wi Ha Jun.
5	3 October 2021	westozcards	Completely over-rated.	Average series at best. Not sure how people have rated this so highly. I found it a snooze fest.Too many ridiculously boring and unrealistic conversations dotted throughout with only a small number of truly memorable moments.
8	1 October 2021	Greyrat17	An Incomplete Masterclass	An emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of seat. The characters are great and despite not lasting long, form an everlasting impression on the audience, the show also touches on the subject of human nature and all that. My personal favorite character is Sangwoo, his development was just (chef's kiss).There's also well planned foreshadowing leading upto the big plot twist at the end that may not be visible at first watch.Although 9 episodes wasn't enough for this show, a lot of things were left unanswered like the In-Ho storyline, where does the organisation go from here, who they really are and what direction Gi-Hun's character will take from here. All of which are hinting for an exciting sequel.Although I'm slightly worried that S2 might not live up to the hype since well, everybody Died and the show has to build an even stronger cast of characters from scratch. Will the showrunners be able to succeed? We'll see.For now let's just make Netflix to fix their awful subtitles, it makes the dialogue look bad.
2	2 October 2021	samkaay	Where was the Serie?	Watch one Episode you have seen it all.This is nothing special, and so predictable, definitive a no brainer nothing more.
1	9 October 2021	eleftheriaB612	Overrated, story told multiple times before	So overrated.Watched in fast forward since it's full of soup for the soul long scenes.Seen much better ones with similar theme..
2	13 October 2021	fruktoosi	Worst series I've seen in a loooong long time	What could I say about this overly budgeted piece of horrid excuse of a series. The story isn't very original, the plot and dialogue are very dull, boring and just bad. The most thrilling part of an episode is when it ends. The characters are unoriginal and poorly acted. I could go on but I will not be tearing my eyes out anymore and waste another thought with this.If someone can enjoy this I would like to know what it is that makes this even barely something to waste time on. If there's something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real. Although when the props were involved, that "joy" faded away faster than it began and made it impossible to ever feel immersed to the world.Unwatchable. Wouldn't recommend.
0	6 October 2021	sameu	Excellent commentary on capitalism	Another death game concept series. This one more grounded in realism.Excellent portrayal of characters, considering most are all scumbags who got themselves deep in debt, like the MC. They are not presented as likeable characters, and make terrible decisions, and harm everyone around them with their actions, which is what led them here in the first place.The MC tries to redeem himself in the games but ultimately he fails to put himself together again after the traumatic experiences and lets himself go, like he did before the games. Instant money doesn't fix you, as a person.There are some issues in the show but overall I would say the good outweighs the bad in this TV series.Excellent pacing, good premise, and overall very solid.The VIP did have horrible acting but unfortunately typical for Asian shows...The ending, I can forgive, for being a second season grab and making less sense.
4	25 September 2021	Stujohnston1	Mediocre at best!	A very slow series, there are many much better Korean series/ films if you want to watch foreign films. Just don't bother with this one - the acting is poor, the dubbing is awful, and the ending is an absolute mess!
6	7 October 2021	yoav-moran	Shiny but empty	There are some good things to say about this show: good actors, good cinematography, some good ideas.But these smokes and mirrors hide the main flow: no soul. Everything there is too engineered to feel real. When hundreds of people stand, they distribute evenly in the space. When hundreds fire, their bodies are scattered evenly in the field. When a vote is made, the distribution between Yes and No is kept evenly until the last one that looks like he just realized he needs to think about it - for suspense. The bad guys are total Nazis, the good guys are banal, similar too much to others as in the Hunger Games.This is a show engineered to make us excited, and like the players looking at the huge piggy bank we swallow it eagerly.
9	16 October 2021	lyor66	Almost perfect!	This show is almost perfect! The visuals, the sounds, the acting are simply outstanding. The characters and storyline have depth and make you feel disgusted, intrigued, charmed, touched, sad, outraged but also contemplative.I think the ending could have been much stronger, but overall it's an almost perfect show that I would recommend to anyone.
1	12 October 2021	braveheartsbilal	Bogus and boring	Very straight and boring nothing special to watch time wasting and i dont know what the f.... With ratings and reviews guys dont try this in your life...
10	26 September 2021	chocolate-lover333	The best Korean show I've seen	I came into this with high hopes being a fan of Korean and Asian cinema and was not disappointed. I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles.
2	11 October 2021	vinoch-605-476406	Is it really good?	How on earth this web series is good. No logic very poorly directed. Over hyped series. Better skip.
10	24 September 2021	grad124	Awesome from start to finish	No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough.
9	4 October 2021	revovgotama	What a great show	If you're on the fence, definitely give the show a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my "all-time favorites" now.It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try.
7	6 October 2021	l1547824845	6.5 point ~ 7	Render and promote the gambler mentality -1Lack of logic driving the plot -1Contrived -1colorful scene +1music +1multiline story telling +1costume design +1Character design +1thriller +1.
6	7 October 2021	ileon68	Good story, bad acting and...	Serie could have been so much better with better actors. The main actors were very bad. I do understand a bad end of a movie, but this one beats all bad to endings. Very unlikely....
3	29 September 2021	ltnguyen-huynh	Another stupid overrating Korean drama	Seriously, 10/10? A true thriller fan would find this painful to watch.
4	5 October 2021	catherine_serbia	120 days	This is just Salo of 2021, this isnt first time we see sickness like this. Vips are fascists. Over all this is show about sad people and it really make u think!
8	5 October 2021	pgecon	Good but a bit overrated	It's interesting, haunting, with great acting and set design. But the ending was disappointing, there are major plot holes, it was too predictable and rushed after the 7th episode.
10	21 September 2021	pnkchik199	Beautifully disturbing	While some scenes were hard to watch.. this movie is jaw dropping, start to finish. I almost always can't seem to get into foreign films but Squid Game had me by my lady balls! It's uncomfortable yet staggeringly exciting. I feel almost guilty for saying that but it's a twist that I have never seen done within a movie. Hunger game, maze runner, none of those can compare. I want MORE!!!!
9	2 October 2021	tryanothername	Well made	Like a blend of 'Running Man' and 'Lord of the Flies' (books, not movies) with a helping of 'The Long Walk' thrown in for good measure.The character development is excellent.I'm no movie critic, but this deserves praise.
9	1 October 2021	aalderson49	Really enjoyed this drama.	Really enjoyed this drama. Many of the reviews failed to pick up on the fact that the Frontman was a previous winner. He shot his brother, maybe he killed him, maybe not. But being through the game he could be regarded as ruthless. Looking forward to season 2 with Ring a Ring of roses, hopscotch, and maybe rounders.
1	30 September 2021	gpinkedi	Why would you do that?	How lame it is to copy the trade mark of one of the biggest tv shows. Even those who didn't watch la casa de papel, knows their red suit with the mask. And in 2021 to make a tv show copying the famous costum of an other show... even if it's an extremely well executed show, it is still really emberassing.
10	7 October 2021	fiona-bishop	Best series for ages!	This series has everything and really captures what money does to people. It's shocking, moving and gripping all at the same time. Fantastic concept and all my grown up kids have watched it and we all loved it.
4	4 October 2021	ducdevalence	Super underwhelming	I really don't get why everybody's gushing over this piece of mediocrity. Honestly, it does not deserve the 8.6, and it does not deserve all the hype around it. There wasn't anything original or anything others hadn't done better before. I'd give it a 5/10, for being perfectly average if it stole only 2-3 hrs of my life rather than a whopping 9, but here we are. I kept watching in the hopes that something crazy was about to happen, right until the end, that justified all the craze, and was left disappointed when it finally ended. Give it a pass if you have anything slightly better than average to watch instead.
9	18 October 2021	residentkidd	I wouldn't play it for a million squid!	There are some games you dare not play. This one is a real killer.The main protagonist is in desperate need to settle gambling debts and provide some much needed medical attention for his sick mother, only to be lured into a deadly game of winner takes all.There's only one problem. The competitors are only too willing to take that bet and stop at nothing to win the ultimate prize.Squid games is a moral dilemma with a sick and disturbing twist. What makes it compelling viewing is it's deliberate attempt to put the audience in a moral predicament and make them want to continue with the games despite doubts or reservations. Very very clever.Without giving anything away, watch it and consider, would you enter a game that gauranteed death or ultimate success?
2	18 October 2021	kaplunv	A sadistic show about mass murdering, artistically produced	It's just paradoxically unbelievable how many people give this perverse show high points and praise it for being well done! And that it has become that popular just after only several weeks!
7	4 October 2021	lone_samurai678	One time watch	Keeping it shortPros1. Interesting initial episodes2. Good cinematics (although some shots were too dark)Cons1. Horrible soundtrack2. Avg acting (in many cases overacting)3. Multiple wasted side stories / appearances.
9	19 September 2021	mrouttt	Brilliant	We go through all the emotions in front of this series.One of the best show ever made, Netflix or otherwise.
3	13 October 2021	kmajchro-03104	Fast forwarded a lot	Thought it'd be more intellectual but just a lot if violence, gore, bad acting, and more violence. Called the main plot line in the first show. If the games were more thoughtful, this could have been good. And suicide so many times? Organ harvesting? Geez, check more boxes.Skip it.
6	14 October 2021	M-a-r-k-MyWords	Great concept, but slow paced	For me the dubbing was a distraction, some of the voiceovers were awful.Certainly one of the most hyped shows of the year but despite a few exciting parts it was on the whole flat and lacking.
6	16 October 2021	marcofleischmann	A very good, short series	Squid Game is a bit overrated for me. But its entertaining from the first to the last episode. The storytelling is very good and the ideas of the games are very nice. I liked it.But in comparison to other series there is missing something. I dont regret watching it, but i dont follow the hype.
2	17 October 2021	ifinkivgonecrazy	Why is everyone frothing at the mouth for this show?	Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off. The only problem with this is that as more and more people got killed, it provided more screen time for the rest of the unlikable characters. The premise and story are ok, but the execution ruins it.
7	8 October 2021	vitorleog	Great series	I enjoyed it but its not sooo good as people are trying to portrait it. I still preferred Alice in Boderland but both series are good and enjoyable.
8	26 September 2021	degodofgaymes	Very good over all but weak final episode	It's a lame ending to a good show. Kind of ruins it.
8	9 October 2021	shimantayan	It Was Fun, But Verry Predictable	Netflix's money on the Korean market finally paid off. The craze that the K-drama holds in worldwide it was only a matter of time to bang.All the hype, thrills and excitements aside, it is actually a pretty much predictable show where anyone with a common knowledge can predict it's final outcome correctly. You will be lying if you say you didn't see who is going to be the ultimate winner after just watching the pilot episode.The best thing about the show were those eventful journey, each and every round of the game were made with all possible thrills but yet again the ultimate results were some easy guess, it is what killed the core suspense of the show. However it doesn't decrease the addiction of finishing it overnight cause it had that ultimate Korean flavours. And when you know it's not only a mad epic game, the massages they tried to draw throughout the battles and emotional triggering was understandably the brightest side of its.
1	5 October 2021	amethystars	Over rated as Heck	Over the top acting, drawn out scenes and an awful ending. I watched the first two episodes and there was so much that could have been cut down. Ending up fast forwarding through the rest. Made sure to stop to watch all the contestants licking honeycomb for their life lol. Wouldn't recommend.
8	25 September 2021	mihran_10	Really Dissimilar Concept show	The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.
7	28 September 2021	assafshisha-halevy	Not as provocative as expected	This is not as provocative as they want this to be. Many books and stories have the same genre of "all humans are capable of doing bad things when pushed too hard".
7	8 October 2021	admira-24407	It was good but I don't really want season 2	I kind a like but it was sad and I don't really like the end...I don't really think I would watch season 2 and the main reason is death of Kang Sae bye and she was great character...
8	17 September 2021	krumblburgh	A Million Squid Says You Love It	Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.
10	3 October 2021	jindalsaurabh-79309	The BEST thing EVER!	I have just finished it watching and I have no words to describe it. Trust me when I say this , It is probably the best thing I have ever seen. Story, acting , casting , production everything is very apt and top notch. I can't believe how perfect of a show is this. It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India 🇮🇳
6	29 September 2021	julianh-91639	Was a 7/10 until the last episode	Good series overall but the last episode made it a 6. The old was trying too hard to sound wise but didn't realize how much of a fool he was. Just because you're old doesn't mean you're right.
1	5 October 2021	udashay	Way too violent and disturbed	Taking childhood games and twisted them in a way that only a very sick mind would do,So what if was done so perfectly, it steel not good,And I'm not saying a words on what kids will say when they see it,You can clap as much as you want, for me it is a big NO.
10	4 October 2021	MetalNickA	Some of Netflix's Best	The Netflix subscription is $9 but the therapy you'll need after this show is priceless.To sum it up as briefly as possible, it's like a sundae made of scoops of Shawshank Redemption, The Purge, and the first Saw movie, with a little bit of Star Wars sprinkled on top.
6	17 October 2021	tj-50890	Shallow plot and characters	The plot makes almost zero logical sense, but the show itself was still enjoyable, even in a comical way. The characters are shallow and lack any realistic motivations, so it's hard to feel anything for the story. I thought it looked pretty nice though, and in general the pacing was decent.
1	10 October 2021	tinsleymlj	O M G	To stupid to watch ! You can feel your brain cells dying !
2	16 October 2021	melsenpai	A predictable snooze-fest	I put off watching this show for a long time, trying not to buy into the hype. To this day, I still don't understand what all the hype was about. This show was just as boring as it was slow and predictable. It's like watching 'The Hunger Games' meets 'Battle Royale' (which has 100x better storyline & character development than this) meets 'Saw' with a light dusting of 'The Purge' and 'Liar Game'.
9	3 October 2021	melvelind	KUBRICK!	The director must be fond of Stanley Kubrick. Everything from the music (same as used in 2000: A Space Odyssey) to the masks (reminds me of Eyes Wide Shut.
1	11 October 2021	phift	Tedious, toxic, ultimately empty and boring.	Capitalist propaganda that has it's victims think it's anti-capitalist.Typical.
1	9 October 2021	vialactea	Garbish	Unfortunately I came across this show because someone else in my house was watching.... dog's crap!
9	19 September 2021	prabhua-00521	Awesome ..excellent ..mind blowing	I ended binge watching this show. Edge of the seat series. Very layered.you will not be disappointed. One of the very best. Hope there is a season 2.
8	26 September 2021	cnh-95573	Wow what a ride!	I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.
10	7 October 2021	akarsh-21744	Awesome series	It is a unique concept based series. Never seen such series ever before. Totally Mind-blowing. It is a masterpiece.Should watch it for sure.
8	30 September 2021	annabelfwatts	Korean Battle Royale vibes	Absolutely fantastic series. Strong memories of the classic 00's Japanese cult classic Battle Royale.In a strange way it's a comforting season to watch. (Now, hear me out!) As we are aware of how many games are to be played, we are able to prepare ourselves each episode for the next game.Of course somewhat predictable storyline with the detective brother and front of house man. That's the second storyline, we need to distract us from the main.I'm not the only one who cried their eyes out when Ali the old man died. We wanted to the good guys to win!Although the protagonist isn't too likeable at the beginning, his character growth is excellent and looks badass with red hair.Cinematography was beautiful. The mash up of bright and dark colours, went so well with themes of the show.Like most films/shows, it's better in the language filmed in, with subtitles. The dubbed version was absolutely fine too!Ending was brilliant. Iconic anime antihero going to get some vengeance.Hoping for another season, great show. RIP sweet Ali!
10	14 October 2021	michaelgrintuch	Remarkable and outstanding	What a great series. How this got out on the back burning for so long astounds me. I'm so glad this finally got made and made it to our screens. Packed full of suspense, clever twists and edge of seat griping moments I highly recommend it.You get pulled into the actors characters from the get go and they all suit the part very well.I really hope they make a season 2.
10	21 September 2021	aakashchoks	Definitely worth your Time	I started it with no boogers but it turned out to be amazing show. If you like Alice in borderland, you will like this for sure.
1	2 October 2021	stephanebaldoli	OVERRATED !!!!!	Boring, predictable, sometimes ridiculous....Managed to watched it all though, but still....There are much better Series out there!Skip that one.
8	11 October 2021	tribalwars	Too sum it all up.	So a father is a waste of space gambling addict who let's his mother and his daughter down all the time, then he goes through the games and comes out on top.How does it end with him letting down his daughter again, what a complete idiot, he is about to board a plane to go see his daughter and he just turns around, letting her down yet again,Man starts off as bad father, meanwhile lots of people die then in the end he ends up being an even worse father.Still enjoyable as a series.
10	5 October 2021	desiirae-03215	I wasn't going to... but I did	And wasn't disappointed. It was actually good!!!! I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was making a big fuss about it. But I gave in and binge watch it! And it was really good! I'm surprised.
9	2 October 2021	barisora	At the final..	Its really amazing drama/thriller serie. At the start,u just think its gonna be easy game and the people gonna have fun together,earn money together. But the thriller starts here and u just realised a lot of weird things. I dont like the end,its should be 1 season serie but I think producter wants another season too..we will wait and see,great serie. Greetings.
9	11 October 2021	aznidentity	Blackpink is popular	Incredible story and performances layered over a timely, universal theme about the dangerously increasing wealth gap. Excellent visuals (I imagine black/pink soldier costumes will be popular) and character development. May develop trust issues after watching.
10	14 October 2021	shone-92516	What a masterpiece.	Exciting, sensational, top series !!! More than expected. Amazingly thoughtful and inspired. All recommendations for fans of this genre!!It is watched in breath and each episode ends in anticipation of the next one being released immediately.
10	8 October 2021	lakshayaps	Fabulous 🔥	One of mind blowing web series available on Netflix. Just unpredictable , loved it.
6	9 October 2021	peymanjahanshahi-64927	Unreal!!!	Unreal, fanciful and really te waiting especially last 3 episodes.. 👎
9	3 October 2021	sisinuri	Wonderful show all the way from South Korea to the world!	Love each episode and the stories and performance of the acter and actresses. The show is a projection of life's absurdity, ambiguity, and desire. In general, It is a reference to humanity and our daily life. I highly recommend movie lovers to binge watch it with their loved ones. My husband had a doubt about the show when i first asked him to watch, and gladly the show proved me right. It was a splendid watch! It made me promise myself to watch more Korean movies. 😅
9	3 October 2021	ayushsingh-49343	Loved the show	Very good story and acting. The VIP's were a bit excess tho.
9	28 September 2021	akosijasher	Unpredictable and Impressive lines!	This series really exceeded my expectations! It's almost close to perfection actually. The rules and regulations of the game isn't that unfair. Moreover, it's the most considerate survival game challenge i've ever seen. Given the fact that they themselves are the one who made the decision to participate.I can see in this series the combination of gantz, saw, the purge, money heist and alice in borderland. If i were to compare this to Alice in Borderland, i definitely would say this is better. Maybe because of the pandemic when it was release and made but nevertheless, i must say that the Squid Game has a very unique content.Games are not too complicated and not that easy but they needs some improvements. Games actually went well because of the certain roles of the players and great portrayals!And lastly im very fond of the thrills the series brings in every episode that makes you end up rushing to see the next scenarios in the next episodez.
7	24 September 2021	liambaron-13959	Overrated but good	Nothing crazy the ending was pretty alright. I enjoyed it but people are going way too crazy over it. Most characters I just didn't really connect with and a lot of things were very predictable.
7	24 September 2021	liambaron-13959	Good but overrated	Enjoyed a lot of it but..It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked.
9	20 September 2021	omorris-71287	This was outstanding! Watch this ASAP	The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality.
9	14 October 2021	ajitnagar-97462	Great show	I feel very entertaining after saw this show.Very good web series.Thanksgiving to all team of squid game.Everyone should watch this show.The old man done a great job in this show.
2	30 September 2021	priyankashahdadpuri	Pretty boring show and overhyped	I mean..if you have nothing else to binge watch then sure..but I found myself fast forwarding the show because it was excruciatingly slow. Also, extremely predictable and no surprises anywhere...what's the hype all about?
3	1 October 2021	leovincent-12940	I had to skip through parts to make it to the end	Forget about people complaining about the acting of the VIP characters, the acting overall was bad. It was distracting, took you out of the scene and was unintentionally humorous.I didn't care much for the characters. I wasn't interest in them. They obviously wanted you to care about the old man but frankly I found him annoying and was hoping he would die and get off the screen ASAP.One of the big "reveals" you can see coming a mile away. The other, you likely won't see coming but I didn't care much when it happened.I wouldn't have made it through the series if I didn't fast forward and skip boring parts... and there were quite a few.
7	24 September 2021	deekleeshy	Great Show, Let down by a few things.	First of all, I'll talk about what I like! The concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.Characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.Other characters not so much, there's an edgy North Korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. "I don't trust people" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, I dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.The dubbing is also awful, I don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was Netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.I'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10.
6	22 September 2021	emiaroux	Too much Plot Hole + Plot Armour	Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man.
6	3 October 2021	iamluisavelasquez	GOOD	Well, it´s not the type of series that I used to watch but This was good.
9	28 September 2021	antantwan	HoYeon Jung Acting debut is it for me 💕	I enjoyed the suspenseful ride and twisted concept of the series! Actor HoYeon Jung stood out most to me; especially after finding out it was her acting debut. Death scenes in this show comes by form of execution, which was almost too much to watch at times. Show lacks no detail within the games facility and does a great job of forming bonds and friendships in such a doer situation! Only thing I wish for was a ending that brings actor Lee Jung-jae closer to his family (daughter) at the end.... More than just a phone call was needed after leaving her standing in the rain like that 😠. Overall great show, great acting, great concept, season 2 worthy Netflix!
10	9 October 2021	rithiksunilsoulmate	Best from Korea	Unexplainable Classic one. And one of the best from Korea.
8	10 October 2021	towolewa	Good psychological horror thriller	This show is really good. If you like horror and thriller u are going to love this. I mean the plot is outstanding and the acting was well almost flawless. The game really messes with your head and u don't know who to trust. I mean the logic inside it is dope. It is survival of the fittest,the series actually made me think that more than one winner can emerge. My favorite game was the glass game .I mean that part was really tense. I also like the fact that they killed of all the characters apart from Jamie sung or whatever his name is. I liked some of the other characters but killing some of the main characters, i did not see that coming. It caught me off guard. Last but not least,the plot twist was crazy i never expected it to be the old man it was mind blowing but then it made a lot of sense because he was player number 1. Well let's get to the rotten part. Some parts were predictable,like the part where that girl sacrificed herself for the other girl and the part where the guy in the mask was the detective's brother. Other than those two events,it was a really good show. I don't really like the way it ended tho i mean if it ended like that's i don't see any point for a season 2. Well it is a solid 8/10 for me.
6	2 October 2021	Emmabey	Why this hype? Ok but not as good as Alice in borderland	This is an good tv show but very melodramatic for no reason! It has the emotion so wrongly translatedGood show to watch but once you watch Alice in borderland this seems so predictable.
10	10 October 2021	bro_ball	Great Binge	This TV series was a great binge on a world that could possibly exist. Underground better people bet on more than chicken fights. Its hard at times with the english translation and the lips not matching the words but overall a great fresh take on a underground better world that may or may not exist.
9	11 October 2021	shaf_h	This show has it all!	I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a long time. Thanks to Parasitie, Korean cinema has been deservedly been propelled.This show is the epitome of cinema from that part of the world. It is poigant, sad, violent, contains moral choices..it has it all. Throughly enjoyable. I do and don't want another season..it can easily be left where it ended.
8	16 October 2021	theperplexedprodigy	A Captivating Breath of fresh air	Squid Game (2021)Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk"The truth is always more heroic than the hype."Jessica LynchPandora boxes come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Amongst them, Hype trains are one of the colossal, if not the most colossal forms prevailing around right now. There are hardly any aspects that can escape the tout blanket devised by the internet community. But, take nothing away, 'Squid Game' definitely stands out to be one of the most intricately enticing shows ever set in motion.Converging a stiffly contrasting set of genres into one, 'Squid Game' furnished a fantastic surge-filled intrigue to the global audience throughout its limited run spanning just 9 episodes. One of the most striking ingredients is that the makers managed to deliver a sucker punch, should I call it rather a KO blow for the kinda impact it had. Many biggies failed in doing so in the past despite having a sizeable script and having moderate longevity.Putting forth the spotlight on the suffering and deprived class of South Korea, the show trudges on forward with copious amounts of twists and turns by pushing the 456 participants to the absolute limits of humanity and make them question the moral code more often than not. With absurdity and surrealism in substantial portions, it gave the writing a license to thrill. 'Terrific' would be an understatement as long as 'making the audience bite their nails on the edge-of-their-seats' feeling is concerned.There is scarcely any room untaken to point fingers at the acting in 'Squid Game' as every single actor on the screen has beautifully engineered and pulled off spellbinding performances; no doubt about that. In a world where the Korean culture is ravaging up the Earth through the music industry, 'Squid Game' has just become the cherry on top of the exponentially growing Korean domination.The reason I believe why 'Squid Game' rose to fame in such a quick period is its atypical unconventionality in making. For the generation that's been built on fantasy, action, adventure, 'Squid Game' came in as a captivating breath of fresh air.
5	24 September 2021	sergeboudin	Good idea, but...	Good basic idea...Being a big fan of battle royal, I was immediately attracted by the pitch of the series. But in the end, the series turned out to be a little too predictable in my opinion. It's not bad but I expected better.I also expected more "gore" scenes. So... Not bad, but I expected much better.It must be said that for me Battle Royal is almost "unbeatable" in the genre :)
6	15 October 2021	lynncolesgp	?	8 out of 9 episodes were fantastic. I was addicted. Would have given it a10 but the last episode👎🏻Come on guys! Make the wrap up understandable and satisfying.
7	23 September 2021	toishac28	Ok show...	I'm watching this on Netflix and with the dubbing it's like watching an anime.
10	3 October 2021	Flametree	Great show!	I love this show, it had me hooked from the very first episode.
9	18 September 2021	daniel-berger88	What joyride of emotions	I started it and thinking this is going to be a B-tvseries but it's AMAZING! When I think I know what's going to happen they throw a curveball.What an amazing tvserie.
10	30 September 2021	johnrussellnunley	Incredible show!	This show will keep you interested from start to finish. Very well written, set designs were incredible, and the ending was brilliant!Only negative I have from it is the same as a lot of other reviews. The VIP's were horrendous at acting!Power through those scenes because it's worth it.
7	22 September 2021	subreality-864-770504	Kaiji without the psychological complexity	Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the "twist" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon.
10	8 October 2021	rkeilitz-19-537915	BINGE WATCHED IT OVER THE WEEKEND BUT.........	Being a fan of Korean cinema I was intrigued by this series and over the weekend became addicted to each episode. I was especially intrigued as I know Jung Ho-Yeon from the fashion industry and worked with her on many fashion shows. Didn't know she could act as well as she did and look as unattractive that her role called for. The only but for me was the VIPS and the manner in which they were portrayed. It was vulgar, crude and racist and a total turn off for me.
10	3 October 2021	jeshuamadden	A beautiful live action anime	This show brings ideas previously reserved for the freewheeling realm of animation to the sh**eating culture of 'throwing what you got at the wall given the right testing metrics' that is streaming platforms. A wonderfully performed and dynamically directed ensemble that couldn't have cost half a fast and furious, watch this show if you have any time at all and remember that you as a member of the 1st world are the villain of this existential cacophony.
8	25 September 2021	ali-persia	Excellent script	Korea is turning to one best movie makers . What a fascinating serie.
6	1 October 2021	uugmn_89	Overrated	I don't why people received it this well.It had overall great production design. But I really hate Korean style of "acting" which is just they whining over everything for the longest period slowing the whole pace. It usually annoys me rather than making me feel sorry. So, eh.
5	12 October 2021	papa_johnsson	Sorry - Not sorry	Sorry to all the fan boys out there.But Squid Game isn't that good.And it is no where near 10 star good as 24% of all users reviewed it to be.The "play a game / complete a course or die"- plot isn't new or innovative. The acting is exaggerated (like the villains from the pokemon cartoon) and the final game/ending/winner is no surprise to anyone. The show has some good moments (most of them in the GGanbu episode), and you easily watch every episode in one go, in a eager to find out who will be eliminated in what order.The best acting perfomances goes to Jung Hoyeon and Lee Yoo-Mi through out their short apperances in the show, but especially in the GGanbu episode.The good perfomance is though quickly forgotton with the performances of the "rich white men" whose acting must be the worst through out the show - perhaps through out Netflix.So - decent, but no where near other shows with this rating.Love the track suits!Btw. How do they fit that many people in that tiny boat; how does the job application looks for this game; whats up with the organ harvest side story; they obviously want to keep the island/game a secret, but yet they send everybody home to tell the world about it.
8	29 September 2021	oraygungor	Anime Kaiji's Korean Version	Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!
7	7 October 2021	tanvir_dr	Very predictable	Squid Game was very predictable, specially Player number 1...This theme is nothing new. I didn't find anything to be super hyped....
6	4 October 2021	RussianRed211	Was good .. not worth the hype	Was a good watch the first 3 episodes. Then I got bored and then it picked up again only to be ruined by the finale. I hated the ending. Gi-hun went back to being a loser and just forgot about his daughter for a year? I get guilt but damn I was hoping he would've at least changed his life. The old man was behind everything..okay but i didn't really care for this reveal. It didn't do anything. I wish we learned more about the Frontman and his brother. He just shoots him and that's the end of it. All in all, it was just alright. Episodes were too long and dragged out.
9	30 September 2021	Nikkiangel002	Loved it, reminiscent of old boy and audition	I loved this, I'm a fan of shocking movies. Example original old boy, audition and ichi the killer.Hard to find anything like them. So I was happy to see something along those lines on netflix! Very enjoyable, only part that didn't allow me to give a ten was the vips I feel there could have been more to them BUT I'm wondering is this open for more series in their regions? Games that they host? Who knows... but I'm excited for more... I hope it goes ahead!
10	12 October 2021	xyntacx	I'm in!	One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals.
3	15 October 2021	whiteyvegas	Ok if you are brain-dead	Again the masses of idiots populating the planet these days have spoken.This is series is boring, and not even in English. It's dubbed which makes the acting even more laughable.Plot holes galore in this comedy.And the most pointless 11 minutes of my life.
9	29 September 2021	shargav	Visually striking and a great story	Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!
8	11 October 2021	temzyreal	Great movie but the ending didn't add up	From the very first episode, it was obvious the series would be great. Nicely paced, full of suspense and drama and great acting.The last episode was however a bit anti-climatic. The conclusion went against the most important thing the protagonist had been fighting for the entire series.A great series in all and a worthy watch.
8	1 October 2021	mazrekajalban	Enjoyable society-critical psycho thriller	I liked the show. It's addictive, well paced and some of the contestants really acted well.A lot of reviewers judge the acting of the VIPs. I would say, it is not bad acting but rather they show how pathetically boring and disgusting people can be, visualizing that just having lots of money makes you no one special.And the end is pretty logical to me. It doesn't require money to be a good parent. If he gambles 20 dollars away which were given to him for his daughter's birthday, why should he act differently when having millions on his bank account? Love is something money can't make a difference on. A true loving father would never be in this game, but rather be motivated just by the presence of his daughter to make his life right and be there for her as a father and not with presents.
8	17 October 2021	rahul-kakkar83	Series worth watching	I would have given 10 but I thought series lost his pace in last episode.barring last episode it was all fast paced ..overall really enjoyed watching it.
10	5 October 2021	Qprjames	Voice overs annoying but still a 10/10	Nice to see something left field and not normal mainstream. The voice overs weren't great. I hope a western company can buy the rights and re-make a new version......
1	6 October 2021	lopusa-8-168595	Atrocious acting.	Have so far forced myself to watch three episodes. The plot is o.k. Don't even mind the violence but the acting is really, really bad. Worst I've ever seen in a movie.Everyone seems to love it, can't figure out why.
7	30 September 2021	edozsa-28-898584	Entertaining but not great	I guess is due to culture differences but the cartoonish style and the hunger games like nonsense of the series gets into the way. It could have been much better with less gore.
10	22 September 2021	fionakatu	A MUST WATCH.....	You don't have to be a Korean drama fanatic to enjoy Squid game, it is great, the VIP team is lacking but otherwise everything else is just perfect............okay this isn't actually happening somewhere right 😂😂😂😂😂😂, with the desperation for money currently in the world I wouldn't be surprised🤦
5	7 October 2021	andrew-w-bunn	Not worth the hype	Imagine Game of Thrones. The first 6 seasons were awesome. Well the first 6 episodes of Swuid Game were too. Then it got dumb. Lost the plot, and resolved zero plot lines.
7	16 October 2021	rosen02	Flawed, but worth watching	A very unique show that explores ideas about human morality in a truly wonderful way. The Korean actors are also excellent. Unfortunately it felt like the story started falling apart toward the ending. Many of the decisions made felt very anti-climactic and I was unsure what they exactly were trying to get across, especially in the last episode. The English speaking actors were also laughably bad.While this show in general is very well made, these flaws prevent me from giving this anything higher than a 7.
9	1 October 2021	linkincooper	Great dramatic	Bloody bt dramatic,Good Korean series.Unexpected fin.
6	6 October 2021	Delta4220	Incredible start, horrible finish	First five episodes are incredible.You get a mysterious setting with characters to which anyone can relate to, even if you are not a few million in debt.After the first five episodes however, things begin to crumble.You start getting fed information about the whole mystery which ruins the viewer's expectations as things like this are best left unknown.The whole plot line of the side cop Cho Sang-Woo who is looking for his brother and is trying to bring the games down is absolutely pointless, he accomplished nothing, only to find out that his own brother is pulling the strings.He dodges compromised guards, disgusting forced gay interactions and runs like a wild animal, outswimming a gps tracker underwater. One would think that they would at least see him passing them on the gps tracker.The old man Il-Nam who's ganbu tries to trick him in order to live, comes back from the dead, only to reveal nothing. His whole buildup and emotion during that episode where he initially dies is absolutely destroyed by having him be a plot twist VIP at the end.The rewatchability continues to crumble with each plot point.The games go from actual logic and quick thinking to absolute chance and stupidity. An entire character, Kang Sae-byeok dies from a level getting self destroyed? Like why? Why do you kill off a character in such a meaningless way. Yes Sang-Woo finishes her off, but brings absolutely nothing to the show. She would have had 5 minutes tops from the incredible blood loss due to a huge glass shard ending her.Yes the American VIPS are trash and the dialogue sucks, but they are not the worst part.The last final epic game that kids play in teams is decided to be a 1v1 as it's the show's epic name. SQUID GAME.The most boring ending game to have a 1v1 with. Would be a hundred times more entertaining if they added more people to it, as it's meant to be played.And to top it all off after our main protagonist gets out of there he is so shocked that he is late to treat his mother and she dies, that he absolutely forgets about his daughter, his friend's mother who somehow did not get her shop taken, as it was mentioned that his friend bet his mother's shop and the young girl Kang's little brother.It takes him a year to actually act and do something, because the old man reaches out to him and meets him one last time.And instead of meeting his daughter to be a good father for once in his life, like he earlier mentions a few times, he decides to be the big strong man and take the games down which had him mentally broken for a year.I understand that he did not want to spend the money, but at least take care of your friend's mom and a little boy. He could have even given a hand to Ali's family after he saved his life.When you get such an incredible start and so much potential in the beginning, it's not easy to keep up the quality. The actors played absolutely fantastic ,but the writers just did not handle those episodes well enough which pretty much ruins the buildup of the previous episodes.
8	4 October 2021	ksears-94132	Solid 8-8.5	For the last +2 years I've been getting into the Korean productions. It's a severely under apriciated market with good scripts, acting and cinematography. Sadly my fellow westerners are hesitant to subtitles but luckily some great series like this one get picked up in the mainstream giving them the recognition deserved.This is as such, and the hype is deserved.Yes the VIP come across as ruining it but I hate to say it, our western loud entitled abrasive personalities is what they are perpetuating and I find the annoyingness of watching the VIP reflects how rude we come across in other cultures and is actually warranted.My only complaint with the series is the ending, I get it but slightly drawn out and clearly just to set up a second season. Otherwise we'll worth the watch.
10	27 September 2021	angelanicole-68272	Horrifying and fantastic	I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating.
6	16 October 2021	cocoanatomical	Entertaining but flawed	The series was definitely inspired by a bunch of films that came before it, but I'm not mad about tbh.I really enjoyed the whole idea of it and the social commentary it involves. That part definitely resonated with me.My biggest issue is that the series feeds into a bunch of problematic stereotypes and tropes that annoyed the heck out of me, so during the last couple of episodes I wasn't really invested in it anymore.There's good stuff in there but it's definitely flawed.
6	11 October 2021	taragoluza	Definitely not a bad show but the hype is for nothing	It's not even THAT original and even though it was interesting to watch I truly don't get the hype this show got over night. I'd recommend it if someone really enjoys the mystical drama thrikler with a lot of violemce type of show/movie, but if not, there really is no reason to watch the show. Characters aren't likeable and like I said even though it seems original at first, there's a lot of elements taken from other movies/shows (Saw, money heist)
10	30 September 2021	blackberryspringers	Unexpected hit!	I've never watched a Korean tv show before but decided to give this a try since it looked very intriguing and it definitely did not disappoint! It's got an interesting story plus some crazy and gory themes. I highly enjoyed it from start to finish!
10	13 October 2021	nspacy	Will go down in history as one of the best	Aside from Narcos and Sopranos this has to be one of the best series ever made. It sucks you in from the very first episode and it drags you in front of the TV to binge watch the entire series all in one day. The acting is incredible. The storyline is suspenseful. The production is magnificent. Overall thank God it took some Asians to make a really good series because Hollywood became all trash.
7	18 September 2021	yusufgndz	Good but not memorable	I feel like I hace seen this before a lot of times. It just feels like hunger games feel wise(Just the context not the spesific things) But in general executed above avarage.
1	18 September 2021	luuthaiquangkhai	The worst among this genre I would say	If you're not used to this Survival Game genre, you might find it exciting. As a long fan of this genre, I can make sure that this series is undoubtedly one of the worst among all. The problems lie severely in 2 key points that make a good Survival Game Film: The games and The story-telling. While the games, without exaggeration, are horribly boring, forcing, and lack the creativity to the point I don't even know if they actually spend time thinking about the game or they just pick it up randomly on the internet. The storytelling method badly worsens it with so many unnecessary scenes and lines. Towards the end of the series, I have to watch it with 1.5x speed, and still, it is irritatingly slow. That is not the worst yet. The SUPER CRINGE appearance of the VIPs just to show labor class discrimination is unacceptable and horrifically unnatural. They try to put on life-lesson so bad that the lesson turns out to be pathetically ridiculous.Tl,dr: this movie is cringed, poorly told, wayy overrated, and definitely one of the worst in this genre.
1	13 October 2021	cnile-56470	Piece of garbage.	Don't waste your time on this pathetic series. You would be better off watching paint dry. Again Netflix produces more garbage entertainment. Gratuitous violence. Stupid plot. Unbearable acting.
8	28 September 2021	andrewss-37477	Great series. Bad english actors.	The headline tells the most. The series in itself is great. But by the time the VIPs came i started cringeing. The Vips sound in their lines like the read it from a paper and their intonation was really bad. Otherwise great series.
5	10 October 2021	stianngresmo	Overrated	Poorer Battle Royal-ish/reality-escape theme. Unoriginal, average story, poor dialogues, cliches, stereotypical. Seen this too many times before.
1	1 October 2021	edxna	Wait, what?	Soo, in 2021 you want to make a tv show that will be seen all over the world. And you can do anything, be really creative. BUT, you decide to steal the trade mark of one of the biggest netflix shows of all time.Even if you didn't see, la casa de papel. You know their red suit and mask.Why would you do that? Even if the show turns out to be amazing, it's so emberassing. They don't feel ashamed? It's a joke.
1	2 October 2021	edxna	Not really...	The idea of the show is interesting, but overall is really boring. I had to skip more than half of the show...There are so weird things, like the actor who speaks with food in his mouth 20 minutes and he is not chewing the food. It's really disgusting.In general, the acting was really bad. Exagerated. Theatrical. I know that in asia this is kinda normal, but you can't take it seriously.And the most important thing. Why would you copy the famous trade mark of la casa de papel? They have almost the same jumpsuit, the guns and of course they have masks too. Embarrassing.Korean Hunger Games in La casa de papel costum. Copy-cat. "Veeery creative". Pathetic.
1	13 October 2021	wynfredo	Drivel	If you like shallow, violent, teen-level, badly acted, badly dubbed, pretty much non-sensical drivel, that is derivative of many other movies / series, then this is for you ! Good luck getting your life back (because there are no refunds). I would give this zero...but it won't let me.
8	15 October 2021	illymflt	A genocide to denounce a genocide: horrifying, overreaching, bold	Brace yourselves: there's a lot to process here, and you need to come fully equipped to do so.Wouldn't recommend to anyone under the age of thirty.A few characters are a bit underdeveloped. But otherwise, the acting is very good - even superb in some cases.A few scenes were a bit off though, a bit rushed.Do watch this in Korean: the dubbed version will not do it justice.
6	13 October 2021	imran_munir	Definitely more hype than substance	Having watched Alice in Borderlands last year which was amazing I was excited about all the buzz about this show. It's entertaining, but the acting is sometimes cringey and other elements drag on like episode 2 when they all go back and decide to return to the game which could've been done in a 15 minute segment. It's fine as a show and entertainment but a stand out show or original it's not. Definitely a case in which social media and buzz has outdone the product.
10	20 September 2021	nadiasamir-48038	Amazing	One of the best kdramas ever. I will défini rewatch t many times.
10	8 October 2021	ckarvanek	Wow	Nothing else to say but wow. This show had me on edge of my seat for 9 hours. Like a cross of Hunger Games x The Purge and Would You Rather. If you like thriller/suspense this show is for you.
6	23 September 2021	mrfantasticoloyeah	Very interesting idea, decent execution.	First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it.
9	4 October 2021	dmooretgs	If Running Man and Battle Royale had a baby	Without crossing that line of spoiler alert there is two glaring issues with this series but not enough to make this unenjoyable.I wish these issues where at the beginning not the end of the series but it was one hell of a watch. As I sat there it made me remember films like Old Boy... fight club and Charlie and the chocolate factory. Last 15 mins of episode 1 it really goes off. It was like of running man and battle royale had a baby.If your not hooked by end episode one then I wouldn't bother continuing but you will for sure. I voted 9 which was a little higher than I would have but people voting 5 is well out or order also so it is my way to balance it out as this has to be the best tv series I have watched this year.
9	19 September 2021	jheslinga	Fantastic.	The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant.
10	10 October 2021	faris-74506	I really enjoyed every minute of this show	It's a great show, I enjoyed it and it's my first time to watch a korean Show.Amazing Director, Crew.
10	2 October 2021	claudiocafaro	Great and exciting	It's very exciting and unexpectedly super! Watched twice in a row. Don't hesitate and check it out.
7	20 September 2021	tim-1526	Worth sticking with.	Netflix seems to be able to find these "box set"versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series.
10	21 September 2021	michaelusvensson	Amazing	I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done.
6	6 October 2021	gianmarcocibella	Could have been gold	When i first heard about this show, the first thing that came to my mind was Money Heist. And not exactly a robbery with a lot of unnecesary extra seasons. I thought huge budget spend on set, CGI and entertainment while the dialogue and storyline is given to the bunch of guys who knows how to do a lame predictible money maker series.I gave it a try and after watching the first episodes i started to think that i might made a judgement mistake.For a moment i was caught in it's mistery, unpredictable events and complex moral issues. You get to judge the competitors while at the same time realize you would probably do the same monstrosity's they are commiting. You see great acting, scenes that make you fantasize abouth the old days in South Korea when all of them where playing these infantile games without their debts, guilt and traumas. Even tough i'm no korean and never been in Korea, i felt nostalgia.Then, the show starts to have a few flaws in matters of coherence wich you try to ignore to keep having a pleasent experience. And for moments, you do. You try to understand the unnecesary plot about the young police who extremely easily breaks into a secret, dangerous facility runned by a cruel, wealthy organization who seem to have been running this games without problem for at least 2 decades. If that's not enough, the showrunners give you a terrible, incoherent explanation about his missing brother. It's almost like the tape of the series came by mistake with a few Mission Impossible scenes in the middle of it.There's a few scenes and cliché dialogues that makes you wonder if the series is looking to play safe as another hit in terms of Netflix views, or more as the daring, complex drama that was, at least, what i was expecting it to be.My other problem was that after 5 episodes i realized i wasn't empathizing too much with the characthers (with the exception of competitor 001, of course).And then i arrived at the Climax of the series. Episode 6. The moral concept is taken way beyond in this game as competitors pick their closest partner without knowing that they're gonna have to eliminate each other. You get to see the real face of all the characthers and the cast best perfomances. There's a lot of betrayal, hesitation, tension, characther exploration and development, and of course, the heartbreaking endings to each of the main eliminations. It was a perfect ending for Jy-Yeong, Ali and the old beloved 001.After that perfect episode, you are blown back to reality and the shows continues to fell apart.1.- One of the more interesting characthers of the show, Sae-Byeok get's fataly injured in the more stupid and meaningless way.2.- The plot of the police guy confirm's itself as totally unnecesary.3.- The closure of the games it's no much more than decent.4.- The plot twist about the old man being the host of the games is just stupid and gave bad closure to a characther who had originally a great arc.5.- The last scene where the protagonist doesn't take the plane in order to fight against the whole organization by himself?? Am I a watching John Wick or something? What about the daughter he promise not to lie anymore and take care of? It seems like they destroyed all his characther development.It seems like, this show had everything to be a cult classic and instead preferred to be the popular easy to digest Netflix hit i was expecting it not to be.
10	25 September 2021	amayawilliams-93788	It's crazy	When I saw the preview it didn't look that interesting but when I was on TikTok there was a scene they were playing a game it was so crazy and I'm like wow I need to watch it so I'm already on episode 5. If you want to watch something would blow your mind this is it.
4	18 October 2021	reyleroland	cliche	Cliche scenes, Cliche endingThey will extend the series with a meaningless scenario to make money. Classic netflixThe hype for this show only about pr.4 rating for the episode and game production.
5	8 October 2021	TS2095	Definitely not a 8.3 rating	When i see so many 9/10 scores I try and compare to other great shows which are deserving of such a rating (breaking bad, Chernobyl etc). The issue I have with this series is the excruciating amount of plot holes and the acting of the VIPs, oh my life where did they find these people? The setup and the design of the games were very cool and I liked Sae Byeok she was badass. Apart from that I thought it was an okay series, seen better, seen worse.
10	7 October 2021	kloomis-53711	Best tv show i have ever watched	This show is the best show I have ever watched. I enjoyed it more than breaking bad, SOA, even game of thrones. Part of the reason why it is my favorite show was the AMAZING set design and art department. Each set looked like the spent millions and millions of dollars and it was so unique and absolutely amazing! Very gory and violent sometimes in a comical way. I love it. Can't recommend enough.
10	5 October 2021	rritter-36797	Loved it	Hype is definitely justified! I loved the show, the actors, the music and the tension! I truly recommend it!
10	1 October 2021	bosssadimp	Must watch	Nothing to say about it. Just wanted to say go and watch this series. This is ridiculous and awesome series I have ever seen.
6	4 October 2021	marcelfernandezromero	Basically Korean Kaiji	Those VIP were terrible and this show and the protagonist, down to the game of crystals is essentially Kaiji.
9	30 September 2021	wessambasmala	It deserves a 10, but giving it 9 stars bc of the VIPS	Do i really need to explain this? The VIPS are cringe in human form. But other than that, it might be one of the best shows ive ever watched.
9	11 October 2021	gsi96	Rough but great representation of the world.	This was a great representation of how the world revolves around money and capitalism. It shows our modern day society in a brutal yet true way.Some scenes might be shocking for some audiences but it really puts your mind in a situation to think and see things in a more realistic way.People who are desperate for money are willing to do whatever it takes to take them, even die, betray and kill other people. It shows how everyone's true nature comes to the surface in the attempt to gain money. Yet the rich entertain themselves on the sight of desperation and think of these people as "horses" as they said that are just a piece in a game and their life doesn't worth anything more than to entertain them.This is the true nature of capitalism and our society. The richest man who created the games out of his boredom who thinks so less of poor people that are nothing more than pieces in his game, to the other rich people who just enjoy the games, to the head of the games, to the workers who are working for them and just obeying orders and who are also divided hierarchically and lastly to the players of the game who mean nothing. On top of that the head of the games continuously speaking of equality during the games giving them a false sense of equality when it actually doesn't exist because the rich are always worth more than them. So they create a false sense of security that every works out equally for everyone so they don't realize the real inequality that exists and that the only ones they have to turn against is each other.If we put this in our society, the people who hold all the wealth and can control the world, to the people who benefit from them like big companies etc, to the people working for them and obeying orders (working force who are slightly more advantaged than the players but also hierarchically divided like CEOs, managers, employees, etc ) to the less fortunate who struggle and are taken advantage of for the sake of the rich gaining more money and apart from that their life means nothing.I would definitely recommend it if someone wants to take a deeper look and don't just stay at the surface of the games.
1	3 October 2021	mayankkhandiwal	Hyped but not even 10% of that hype	Netflix said it will be the biggest series but I think it is not even 10% of Alice in borderland or Money Heist.
10	10 October 2021	pavankumardangare	Full serious	Sometimes we can predict who is behind the all games , also the old man is overactive.
10	12 October 2021	cmbrown-53238	Amazing!	I checked it out after all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this if you haven't seen it. The acting is good, storyline is good, scenery and special effects are good too!
8	21 September 2021	wyattmullenax	Better Than You Think	Even if you're not a fan of dubbed over movies this will catch your attention. The story is incredible and messed up in a beautiful way.
6	10 October 2021	nesrineben	Strong premise, mediocre execution	The premise is interesting end entertaining. However, the character development is very poor and random (ie. Characters decide to suddenly become ethical out of nowhere and despite it contradicting their whole previously established traits).The justification behind the games is also very underwhelming even though it was meant to be some kind of big reveal.This show gives very much a "we live in a society" vibe... Some plot twists feel like they were written by a 12 yo middle schooler.I don't know if it's the norm for Korean shows but sometimes the acting feels cartoonist although most of the time the acting is pretty strong. Also beautifuly shot.6/10 don't believe the hype.
10	9 October 2021	omiitmtech	The finest webseries	Squid Games' is the finest web series you can watch today on Netflix. And, if you are a fan of South Korean cinema, you will love every bit of it. They arguably produce the highest quality films in the world.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!!
8	10 October 2021	rory-83461	Great Show, ending wasn't the best, however would still recommend!	Slow burn at the start, but we'll worth pushing through the first episode. The games are entertaining and full of twist and turns. Good character growth. Only thing that is stopping me from giving this a ten is, the rushed ending or so it seems and the VIP's less than stellar acting.
5	11 October 2021	sixtsense-49464	A few good episodes, but mostly disappointing.	I think this is a great show for teens, but not for adults. The "social commentary" is very surface-level and predictable. I know its supposed to be a fun show, but the insane amount of plotholes and the typical "over-the-top" korean acting made it very hard for me to enjoy. I cant recommend it, there are much better shows on netflix.
7	28 September 2021	rwwxsw	Possible plot hole?	When they kill the doctor there is 39 of them left.The woman was moved to the next game and 38 of them went to play the marble game, but when the game was finished only 16 of them came back and it should have been 19, since they played in pairs.
10	5 October 2021	aaron-95245	Great watch	One of the recent best webseries... Absolutely entertaining.... Must watch.
1	14 October 2021	shubhamkakirde	Very boring and slow	Absolutely nothing happens till the 3rd episodes. We just watch the actors chitchat with each other. The series would've been good if it was fast........
7	18 September 2021	imizk	Love it!	Everthing is amazing i really like it so much i hope there is season 2.
10	21 September 2021	mlpvera	Beautifully made	I can't wrap my head around this series, it's absolutely one of the best series I've seen. It's bingeworthy and keeps your attention all of the time. The characters have great development and the story is not afraid of killing off characters either (duh). But my favorite part has to be the design and symbolism. The colors, outfits, game rooms etc. From the boxes the corpses are put into to the contrast of colors. Everything just makes sense together. No one is safe in these games. And the ending is quite satisfying with a full circle moment. I recommend everyone to at least watch the first episode. If they enjoy it they will certainly enjoy the whole series.
5	6 October 2021	grahamrob-37686	it hooks you in	Real cr@p acting poor dialogue poor dubbing but still hooks you in, twist at the end let's hope there is not a sequel.
9	17 September 2021	noah0948	An exciting show	This show is really good and exciting. The cast is doing a really good job and I cared for the characters. The sets and camerawork were also beautiful there was not much action but when there was it was well shot. And finally, the story was solid there was only one plotline that wasn't properly ended but aside from that it was really good.
9	10 October 2021	zeeboiproductionz	Once u start you can't stop!!	This series was a breath of fresh air. The cinematography , the script , the acting in this series was amazing . I highly recommend people to watch this . The characters are so well put together and memorable. The games and brutality of it make it edge of the seat action!!
10	6 October 2021	toapheebs	You will not regret!	I wont say much but just WOW. It has everything I was looking in a series & more.(Some saying VIPs sucked yeah but that doesn't affect the series much Idk why they're making it a big issue)A total bingeworthy content kudos to the creators & actors.
1	17 October 2021	panosmamali	Overhyped	Predictable, boring, distastefulI watched this show because everyone was talking about it. My brother and father both told me it was great. I watched the first 2 episodes and I thought "Alright maybe it needs time".Then I watched the other 2 and I knew exactly what was hound to happen after.The plot was boring, the side stories were completely useless and the acting was below par. Don't watch it.
10	21 September 2021	mateicosminmc	Another great Korean idea	I just came here to say that it worth every second.
7	8 October 2021	ellenmd53	Good for a weekend binge	The show's writers need some alone time with the script to polish the rough edges. As an American, I don't know the principal actors or "VIP's" although I agree that the 5 main actors weren't given three best material in the first place.Misogyny runs rampant in the writers room with an unfair amount of women actors being put into some 1950's melodramatic saccharine.But it's fun. Lots of blood. Weirdness. Almost John Waters-esque.
10	2 October 2021	alinabilabass	One of the best of all time	This is one of my best short series of all time, it is so attaching and make you wanna finish it in one day, yes it is so violent and scenes might really disturb you, but.... I love it.
8	30 September 2021	lienile	Good, but there are better shows in this area!	Love this types of shows when they have to gamble for there survival. Its so good and you get cut up and you just cant stop watching. The only bad thing was of course the vip acting, almost as bad as my english! If you like this types of shows you should go and watch "Alice in borderland" on Netflix. I personally find it better and with cooler games, better story and better characters! But thats only my opinion:)
10	29 September 2021	angelamastroianni	One of the best show I've ever seen	After watching Attack on Titan I felt empty, I couldn't watch netflix anymore.But this one guys, I don't know what to say. A cult! One of the best and emotional shows ever produced! Episode 6 represents TV at its peak.
9	22 September 2021	inesfiliparasteiro	Korean version of black mirror/ hunger games	This Korean drama/series makes me remind of black mirror a lot because of the system of the game and the VIPs. I didn´t like how the VIPs talked because it seems they were reading... This serie talk about the things that someone is capable of doing to earn money, even kill the dearest person for you. Not everything it is what seems in this drama.
9	9 October 2021	mixmaxmove	Amazing Concept/Who Hired The V.I.P. Actors?	Only reason it doesn't get a 10 is the V. I. P. Episodes. They were HORRIBLE!
7	29 September 2021	eminayuuki	I get the hype still	Definitely predictable and not original. Plus too much exposition.By unoriginal, I mean that this kind of story already exists, but I get the hype since it's a visually attractive adaptation of a pre-existing plot.Anyone thinking this is fresh needs to watch more movies. And "the similarities stopped at the first game" my a**. The glass bridge is just a lesser Sky-High Hopscotch.It could have been just one season, since whatever the old man's motive is, it ain't that interesting.7 = good.
6	15 October 2021	MARVIN_SHO	Just looked because of the hype	In fact, I don't understand why there is so much hype about him, this is just a Korean series on netflix, and it has become most popular because of all sorts of parodies of it, and fashion games based on them (Roblox, Minecraft, etc.) and lately everything has become popular because of Korea as the same BTS (which I hate khem) but the series itself did not hook, watched one episode and forgot.
10	21 September 2021	villarosie	Had me hooked from the start!	Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors.
7	30 September 2021	gmppgmxwwp	Not too good but okay	I dont like the ending, instead of move on and visit his daughter, the main chose to play the game again?And the conversation among Vips really cringe.
10	21 September 2021	pikie-88742	Amazing show!	This show is absolutely amazing! You should definitely watch it.
7	2 October 2021	AstelleVey	A blast to watch mixed with disappointment	I enjoy watching a lot of death game movies and shows similar to squid game, so when I heard its popularity I was instantly intrigued, not only was it so talked about, but it had really high critic scores. Now, I try my best to not have ratings or my expectations to cloud my judgement when watching, so that's not the reason why I think squid game is only a 7/10.With all the other content I've seen with similar foundations, this one stands out. Not only is it a series with a high budget, but it's Korean. I'm not well knowledgeable in the Korean culture, it's film/show industry or it's childlike games, but I was definitely shocked when watching this. Most western content I've seen usually has low budget and pretty weak acting, but this is the complete opposite here. These well written characters were so easily brought to life by everyone....except the VIPs but I'm sure everyone knows how bad they are. Not only was the acting incredible, but the accompanying score and visuals made it so this show was so excellently crafted.The main plot of squid game is relatively simple. There are people who need to pay debt and so they play games to win a lot of money, nothing original. They get tested/challenged by someone, who randomly goes up to them, targeting them, to see if they are worthy enough to enter their competition of children's games. This test is simple, play ddakji. Winner pays the other 100k won. Since the player cannot afford it after they lose, the businessman slaps them instead, and they keep going. The test here is, will the player keep on gambling the money they don't have. If so, then they get handed a business card, containing the number to call if they accept the invitation. So already, the start shows us how these games will work out, you're gambling something so heavy for something you so desperately need in return. So when they're on the island, they play 6 games over 6 days, death happens every time, you get the idea. I think it's here I should mention, there is a background meaning to a lot of this. The Front Man sometimes mentions about equality. However, if we take this morality of this, some events just don't match up. The biggest example I can think of is the bridge with glass tiles. This was so incredibly stupid that it was here (well before with the VIPs]) that started the train wreck of the show. In the other games, if you had a choice, you still were able to win:-Choosing the shape for ppopgi, despite being at a huge disadvantage for choosing the umbrella, it is still possible to beat it.-Choosing teams for tug of war, even if you have a weaker time, you can have strategy to win-Choosing the pair for the marbles, we saw many ways how this could be done, either manipulation, gambling, or skill, yet you still had a fair chance if you knew what you were doing. Even one guy playing used the morality of equality to try and increase his chances of winning because he knew that's how the games work.-But then you have the glass bridge. The commentary by the VIPs in the show were indeed correct. Going straight at the front and straight at the back are both disadvantages, which is true. However, the people at the front so clearly have a disadvantage that's it's basically impossible to win if you're in the first 9 people. Sure, there could have been strategies thought of to test each glass, but for games that made it so you still have a chance no matter what you pick, this is a bit out of place. Oh and that glass explosion at the end is incredibly stupid. Tbf this whole game is stupid, were they really gambling their entire playercount on 1 game? We know this is for entertainment after all, as they even decided to make the bridge harder last second. What's so entertaining about all your players dying at once?Ok so that's not to say every other game is perfect. Red Light, Green Light has the problem of bullets not being 100% fatal allowing for 2nd chances, other people being moved when half the game stampeded in retreat, the inconsistency of what considers "movement".Another huge problem with the show is the subplot. The plot of the detective (I think he's a detective?) searching for his brother. Not only did I just not care about this plot because we don't have much going for the detective character, but it's ending and setup is so flawed. Why not check on the constantly suspicious looking guard earlier? Why was he able to get away just because the doctor shouted? Why did he waste his only bullet at the end? And not only that, the reveal that the front man was his brother, whilst not obvious, wasn't "WOW I did not see that coming" either. In fact, after the reveal, the sub plot just ends. Nothing comes out of knowing who the Front Man is. This whole subplot was just useless in the end, and only served a purpose so we know what's happening with the doctor. Speaking of which, I get why he got shot in the end, but what if he was forced into helping the guards? Why did the guards even try to kill him when they need him for their scheme? If they had to kill the doctor, why not the other players who got told about the game by the doctor himself? You could probably remove around 90% of this subplots content and you would have the same thing in the end. The detective doesn't achieve anything, we the audience don't obtain anything out of it besides from an attempt of a huge shocking reveal.Despite my problems with the plot, the characters in this show are amazing. Nearly all of the ones we spend time with are unique, interesting and dynamic. Seong Gi-hun is an incredibly executed character. Being quite naive yet smart at times, he's more human than the characters he surrounds himself with, and yet overtime, his humanity starts to decrease, but it never breaks, even in the final game, he couldn't bring himself to kill his childhood friend, despite all that trauma, and even offered a withdrawal from the game. And yet, his emotions still cloud him. He's not perfect, he's a flawed individual. We see this so clearly at the start, when he finally wins ddakji and was about to slap the businessman, so eager for revenge, so into his anger at losing that he forgot what he was playing for. This was so beautifully mirrored in the last game, the squid game. At many moments, he had the chance to get victory, to walk into the circle. He didn't have to fight or kill his friend, he could have let the guards do it for him once he claimed victory, but because of his anger, he was too into it, he forgot what was on the line, and despite how in the first episode he was easily able to attempt the slap on the businessman, here he couldn't bring himself to kill him despite the fighting. It's so subtle yet that character development is huge. Although he definitely does have plot armour. Every single game, he won barely, always at the last second. Even with the fight against his best friend, he was about to die but quickly turned the tables. I'm fine with this happening for the first 2 games or so, but every time? It gets old and repetitive.Cho Sang-woo is another incredibly written character from the start. He's cold. He's in this to win. And, opposite to Gi-hun, his humanity actually breaks down as time goes on. Sang-woo is, without a doubt, the smartest player in the game. He tries his best to increase his chances of winning, he tries his best to eliminate possible threats. He's the cause of the most emotional scene in the entire show. He looks the least likely to be someone like him, and yet it makes sense. You don't want to feel human in this game, you need strategy to increase the chances of survival, him being this character makes him the smartest, and yet, Gi-hun can't accept it. Ironically, Gi-hun keeps calling him smart but when it comes down to his smartest thinking, Gi-hun rejects it. He rejects the fact his childhood friend is like this. Not only was their chemistry so natural, but when they had conflict, that also felt so realistic. My only problem is, I just don't feel like he's a real character himself. What I mean is, we know Sang-woo isn't a psychopath, he does what he has to do to survive, but yet he shows no signs of remorse. No guilt. And it would have been better if at the start of the show, he wasn't already like this, making his change much more damaging.Ok so Sae-byeok is a pretty ok character. She has an interesting backstory, but the show just doesn't utilize her to the best they could. In episode 2, we had the chance to see the main characters and their lives, them realising it's much better to be in the games. And yet, we barely get any screen time with her. I understand at this point she wasn't a main character yet, but they could have at least done something to make her feel more complete. And then with the marble game, we see glimpses of sadness from her after killing that one irrelevant female character, and yet, that wasn't touched upon either. And for the most irritating thing, her death. Ye her death is dumb. Well not all of it. I like the fact Sang-woo finishes her off, but the fact the glass even exploded in the first place is just a problem. I thought everyone was supposed to have an equal chance, Front man? I guess not. Felt like a cheap way to write in her death so the 2 childhood friends can have a 1v1 I guess.The other characters are great too, but unfortunately I don't have room to explain here sadly. Ji-yeong and Jun-ho are still irrelevant characters, Deok-su's death feels so out of place also, and the final twist at the end of the show is dumb.Also one thing that triggers me a lot about this show is the use of slow mos. Stop!
10	9 October 2021	taylorthormod	Easily a 10/10	Perfect. Absolutely incredible. Especially the last 4 episodes. A truly incredible message about life, death, struggle, success, and the poor and the rich. Fully entertaining for every second. There are very lovable and well developed characters that you can't help but get attached to, and evil characters that you can't help but hate. Great story. Definitely a 10/10.
10	6 October 2021	workforcoco	Best web series ❤🔥	One of the best web series.. Loved it🌸🔶all the characters are amazing.
7	23 September 2021	ajs321	What was the point of the police officer (frontman host brother)	The story of the police officer was just pointless. He achieved nothing, other than killing like 2 random people.
8	29 September 2021	Jayslapit	Amazing show definitely worth experiencing	Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, "Hell", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more.
10	9 October 2021	shugineer	Fav part- red light green light	I just can't get enough of the games! What a mess! I hated saw, liked hunger games, loved this show. I loved all the characters. I didn't understand why they had those side stories with the harvesting bodies and the cop. Really added nothing to the story. Otherwise this show is so omg it'll keep you watching especially when all the bodies fall in red light green light. What a wild ride! I write novels and this writer did something in this story that I can never do to my stories. Kill them off! Lol.
10	7 October 2021	editkadita	BRAVO!!!	OMG Korea!!!This is how is done!!!This is an exaple when you went above and beyond for a viewers!Recpect Korea!!!
5	1 October 2021	lolimani	It's alright, doesn't deserve the hype	It is entertaining but I wouldn't say it's the best. It's predictable and the acting was not what i'd expect from a show hyped so much. I watch a lot of kdramas and I can understand why it's hyped with people that don't watch kdramas, it is entertaining, deadly game.I love watching psychological thrillers, but this was the same trope over and over again. It's getting pretty boring. I gave it 5/10 because it was entertaining at some points to watch, but I wouldn't say it's good.A lot of psychological thrillers like tunnel, train, abyss, etc. Are a 10/10 to me.
7	4 October 2021	yvonne-74566	Interesting but not attracting	In the many number of TV series in game topic, Squid Game is worth watching and elaborate. There are a lot of fun and carefully prepared foreshadowing, however they're not new enough to attract my eyes. The bad VIP and leader to feign death are easy to recognize.
9	5 October 2021	dmbarnhamart	A pleasant joy	An absolutely joy to watch, even with the dark themes.Is it perfect? No, it is not. There are certainly things in it that annoyed me (the police officer subplot)But over all I still absolutely loved the story.I wasn't keen on the ending though. This would've been perfect as a once off story with the MC defeated and alone, skimping money off bank managers. But that's my personal opinion.
5	10 October 2021	wiskeybreakfast	Morbid, unforgiving and tragic	What are people prepared to do for money and survival? A lot obviously.Our poor protagonist- a sympathetic middle aged man with No luck in life gets the chance to participate in some kind of game Where to lose means elimination and elimination means death. The show is cruel and twisted in Ways that are hard to imagine. The actors are good and i like the hero - that was the only reason i followed through the whole show. If it wern't for those things i had given it a below average rating. This was a sick show to say the least.
8	11 October 2021	FilmFanbay-80502	Wow	I have to admit I haven't watched it all yet, but the first few episodes I have seen are not what I expected. I am loving it but for my sanity, I need to take it slow. Acting is great as is the plot. Idea and really everything. I recommend it...but be prepared.
10	7 October 2021	ttwiersma	Loved it. Masterpiece. Edit out the VIPs. Not needed.	It's a 10/10. Just edit out the VIPs, you don't need them at all. Loved it. A masterpiece.
8	6 October 2021	atakanturhan	Makes you question our daily life	Interesting and a smart story. Until the VIP guests comes, all looks perfect. Unfortunately the performance of non-Korean cast is far below the Korean cast. Other than that, I have really enjoyed the series.
10	1 October 2021	jinseongim	Need 2nd season	Too short. Need more. Watched all the episodes in one day. Could not stop.
10	2 October 2021	jhp2025	Not for everyone consumption!	Too many bloody, violences, cruelties, and inappropriate scenes. I suggest that it could be made softer and a bit more elegant, then it could be more interested to watch it. I can only give it 10 starts because I cannot make that movie, but I can help them to make it better.
5	6 October 2021	aneesha	Promising, but doesn't quite deliver.	To many similarities with The Hunger Games. The contestants do have a choice whether to participate, though.Too many plotholes as well.
9	24 September 2021	loriscite-832-352056	Keeps you on the edge of your seat kind of show	What a treat ! Edgy, emotional. Above all ? Disturbing. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. Oh boy was I wrong.Nicely produced, almost perfectly executed. You feel the tension from start to finish. The actors are are spot on (apart from the VIP's in episode 7).You feel and want to know more about them.This is how good it is.Have a go, you won't regret it.Pure entertainment.
7	17 October 2021	ianimi	This can take your time fly and think about some stuff in life*	Serial is innovative and exciting..But there are too much badly done things, misses...and of course it's not realistic and I'm not talking about the main theme!I think that the place where people killed each other for money can exist, but the way that these people play and act its not the best I've ever seen on the screen, believe me.If you are asking yourself whether watch or not - better watch, but for the idea, watch to think later of some things..don't try to find the weakest moments, so you can enjoy full-time!
6	22 September 2021	cuti1406	A below average series	This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues. This one does not earn its score.
6	13 October 2021	Cluuxp	It has its moments.	Was recommended to watch the series and watched all episodes over a few days. There are good moments and great characters here and there. But overall the series can be described as a friend of mine said as gore-porn. If you like bloody series like the walking dead then this is something for you.The series starts strong but struggles to keep the level.I hope that they do not make a second season as this should just stand alone.Happy to have seen it. Not going to watch it again.
9	5 October 2021	Neekyrodrigues	Are you willing to take a chance?	Another shining example as to why more people should stop betting on an old horse like Hollywood and start putting their money on International Cinema. In this instance it's Korean cinema, Squid Game is a beautiful example and a potential gateway drug for many to get into Kdrama or maybe just international cinema in general. If you're tired of the sequels, prequels, reboots or remakes then take a risk into the world of subtitles and watch this. You'll find yourself with something new, fresh and potentially eye opening.
9	18 September 2021	missessence78	Best description? Uncomfortably genius! And quite disturbing!	Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*
5	10 October 2021	Anniejamesmangarova	It's a nice show, but ...	The idea is great, no matter that it's similar to the Hunger Games - after all the original script is not earlier then 10 years old, before being financed by Netflix. I'm really impressed by the South Korean's actors - incredible work! Nevertheless the plot was very predictable and on top of that I know what is going to happen and it's happening for 10 more minutes on the screen - very slow and protracted action ... There were some moments, like the dead of the policeman/ brother, where I wasn't sure what am I watching - Indian tv series with a lot of slowmo reactions to a dramatic action or what?
10	20 September 2021	anniehuang129	Thrilling, complex & still coherent.	Engaging from start to end. Exciting, shocking, yet with a fresh and unique storyline that's delightful to watch and visually pleasing. Actors play amazing performances. I could compare to hunger games, but probably 10 times better.
5	6 October 2021	maysa-cda	Based on an anime	Interesting, but not original and with over the top dramatic acting that I personally don't like. That are much better south korean shows out there.
4	11 October 2021	bizdaddy	Good premise but...*Spoilers from first episode*	All the main characters were pieces of sh.., Gi-Hun is a worthless human being who forgets his daughters birthday then gambles the money his mother gave him away. Someone who actually cared would have given us someone to cheer for.
9	8 October 2021	nazgol-human	Amazing show! Humanity. Friendship. Betrayal. Comedy	Comedy. Great acting! Love this. Can't wait for season 2.
1	21 September 2021	semi-elsharef	The ending is rubbish	The series was really interesting and entertaining till the last half an hour of the last episode. The ending is rubbish.
6	26 September 2021	Vicissitude24	it was good til epidode 8	The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode.
8	4 October 2021	velzing22	The VIP cringe level...	It's like producer/director never met or see any English speaking person.
6	17 October 2021	minivolt	it is poor...	Firstly, anyone reviewing this as 8 and higher needs to watch some proper cinema and recalibrate..I dont care that this is sadistic show on par with Saw series just with less gore..it is just the predictability, mediocre plot and the poor ending..he met 'the guy' at the end.. why is he saying that he wants to know who are they?And wait what he is coming back lolsuch a cheap ending.
9	30 September 2021	fbrustolini	I don't care about the VIPs performance	Never mind about the VIPs bad acting comments. They play such a secondary role and they have few seconds in a couple of episodes. Yes, they suck, but it doesn't have any influence on how good the show is.It's an amazing show that is way more than that. Outstanding performances from korean actors, great storytelling, and korean approach at its best: drama, thriller and comedy all in the same box.Have fun!
9	20 September 2021	shanekoggg	Great show, horrible VIPs	I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting.
4	5 October 2021	draigen1	Great premise, poorly executed-too much hype	This could have been great. The writing is just really sloppy. I can look past the bad acting from some of the cast because it fits in the Korean and Anime style/genre, but the plot holes and bad writing is a deal breaker. Just one example: in the tug of war episode, they had to break up into teams of 10 ppl. But there is no way there would naturally have been the correct number of people to make exact teams of 10. Just bad writing. It's been hyped a lot. There are lots of these types of instances, but I won't type them all.
9	29 September 2021	bartvotten	I shed manly tears	I lost it at the end of the Gganbu episode. Amazing show.
2	15 October 2021	istvan_b01	Utterly stupid, complete waste of time.	First I thought it was rated by Koreans only who were driven by bias and not merit, but seeing the high rating coming from the western world makes me question our mental state and not theirs.Pointless extrem violence/murder is not relatable, period. In this series it is also accompanied by stupid storyline, hectic dialogs, and very poor acting. Result? Highly rated , most watched series. Well done us, how did we get here??
1	8 October 2021	info-704-60546	Boring and shallow	Are we supposed to feel empathy for a man who becomes a billionaire and then chooses his own vindication over his daughter? Plot is boring and shallow, characters don't develop and the reason behind the games is 'rich people get bored'.Full of tropes, misogyny and a sprinkling of racism. Not even that gory, not scary or tense, and the VIPs are like true blood's worst reserve actors.
3	10 October 2021	cmdr104	Overrated	I honestly don't know what all the fuss was about. I watched it and thought the entire series was mediocre at best.
7	9 October 2021	christiansommer-787-81523	Could have lost the bad acting VIP's	It grew on me after the first episode, it was somehow addictive so that must say something about me. It lost it's appeal when the VIP's were introduced, rich American businessmen who pay to see people get killed, I get that that is the story but the really bad acting and dialogue of these guys was cringeworthy. Shame, because the Korean/Pakistani cast were exellent, each and every one of them.
10	21 September 2021	shib047	Mind Blowing	Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!
6	9 October 2021	dries-gettemans	Amusing yet predictable and sometimes dull	Fairly above average for Netflix. Yet very predictable, the characters were shallow and most of them very annoying. From the moment the old man 001 was so called shot (but not seen being killed) en the episode ended with the shot of a wrinkly hand taking the rabbit mask off... 🙄 Who OH who would be behind the frontmans mask? Very predictable...The storylines and -themes were randomly and shamelessly stolen from other movies.6/10. Amusing but no material for a cultstatus. I think they orderd too much red overalls for CDP and made something new to recycle them...
1	6 October 2021	alitaker-0	a bad copy of Kaiji	It was a very bad series. In fact, it was an incomplete and dirty copy of Kaiji anime. This series had a lot of story holes. The story structure took on the dark aspects of Darwinism but could not show the consequences. Director By putting on pleasant music, tries to make the audience sympathize with a psychic killer who has killed many people. The series is very immoral and is not recommended at all because it portrays humans as animals without any consequences for this. I also do not understand the director's opposition to religion and God. As if he just wanted to attract the attention of big companies. I suggest you watch Kaiji anime because it is really a masterpiece. .
10	8 October 2021	emily_kate1	Captured me from Red Light Green Light	Squid vs SawSquid Game was dark, weird and I wanted more!The games reminded me of the Saw movies - live or die, make your choice... or in this case; play properly or die, make your choice.Most games were exciting, except for the marble game. I found that a little bit long and the players waffled on a bit with their personal stories. (I fast forwarded those parts).Bring on more games, less waffling on, and more strategic twists rather than the in depth story lines of the players involved.If you're bringing out a season 2, I'd love to see intense games that go for longer.
7	29 September 2021	jackmatt2	Was great until the VIPs arrived	A unique film and a nice concept. I was enjoying this series until the VIPs arrived and ruined it in about episode 5 or 6. I think these VIPs just happened to be teaching English in Korea at the time and applied for some extra cash. The acting was horrible and severely cheapened the whole film. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series unfortunately. I can't recommend this film to family because the acting form the VIPs is just so embarrassing.NETFLIX - remove/replace the VIPs with real actors - budgets can't be that tight.
8	20 September 2021	akshayraj-t	Would've been excellent had I not watched alice in borderlands	The show is still great though and can't wait for season 2.
7	28 September 2021	lawton092	Good but predictable	Me and the missus really enjoyed this series we watched it all in the evening.Saying that we both thought the ending was a little too predictable and we both had an inclination about the ending from episode 2.Give it a watch by all means because there's some really good characters and action but don't expect a blockbuster ending.
8	27 September 2021	eliasnov	Great until the VIP came	Remarkable series but the VIPs must be the worst actors i've ever seen.
6	8 October 2021	ChristopherNuin	Good idea but not original at all.	Idea was solid, but it was nothing new. There are plenty of movies about people getting killed or killing each other as part of a game for wealthy folks. VIPs ruined big portion of the last three episodes, they were a disaster. I don't understand why they went with some poor actors spitting lame lines in poor English, they could have introduce some serious Korean VIPs. Last episode was disappointing and the winner was known from the very first episode which made the game pointless to watch.
10	9 October 2021	jating	Great show with a refreshing concept	One of the best shows on netflix in recent times . Background score is just amazing.
7	4 October 2021	florimaziri	VIP sucked	I felt like I booked hunger games on ali express. However the show was very catchy and mostly predictible. I enjoyed watching the games and the emotions after it. The end with the VIP is very very bad, which brings me to an average/good rating.
9	22 September 2021	brettmitchell-95971	Very entertaining	Besides a few bits of bad acting this series was very entertaining.👏
8	9 October 2021	unholyprophet	Human behavior is the real protagonist, plot is just a backdrop.	An excellent modern fable that strongly resonates with the debt crisis (specially in South Korea). It is more of a psychological commentary about human behavior in life/death situations.
8	20 September 2021	wkwong-80785	Season 2?	I have finished to watch this Korean Drama, it is very good, will this renews Season 2?
10	29 September 2021	luketurnill	Amazing show	The best show I've seen in years.....the characters are rich, the story is nuts, crazy, emotional, and brutally violent.
2	28 September 2021	KHamblin-1	Started wonderfully, ended stupidly!!!	Wow, this got off to such a great start and sustained it for 6 episodes. I liked it so much that I binge watched it. Then in episode 7 it did a face plant!! As many reviewers mention: the VIPs are unbearably ridiculous and painful to watch. But in addition to that, in my opinion, the ending is ridiculous!! Such a let down to what was a glorious series. Sorry I wasted any time at all on it!
6	30 September 2021	eldiankyo	Not bad but...	It's really similar to Battle Royale (book), or the movies Exam and Circle.I knew that 001 knows what's going on since the first episode. It was a mistake to give him the number 001. I thought he was the winner of a previous game, and he voted against the game at the beginning just to increase his chances (non-returning players).Huge mistake is to "kill" somebody when the camera is not showing them. (001 and the annoying woman both at the marble-game) Movie fans know the rule: If you don't see them die, they are not dead.Also at the marble game there was a plot hole, they could have win if the 2 players just swap bags. This way they both won the 10 marbles from their teammate, so they are both winning at the same time. (You don't have to own 20 marbles to win, the rule was just to win the marbles of your partner).In the last episode 001 says it was boring to watch these game he just wanted to play it - but there were documents from 1998 so he was bored for 20+ years? Interesting from a genius.I won't rewatch the series, but if there will be a second season, I'm in.
2	29 September 2021	Comet56	This show is so predictable that I was angry at myself for wasting 9 hours	I have an account for 10 years on IMDB but it will be my first review. I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wastedThe show is only saved by the great acting.Never again.
10	5 October 2021	yadavyadav	Alice in borderland lovers step in!!!	Best show to watch if you love AIB.Worth for a bingewatch. Thriller series lovers shouldn't miss.
5	16 October 2021	ahmedalmindelawy	What is the new thing that came with!!! NONE	I just dont get it, what is the new thing or new problem that it would solve!!! No thing new and the same idea with some expandings.Not accurate in so much details like the count of gamers or other things.IMDB is suffering from over rating these days.
1	5 October 2021	qhka	Netflix garbage	Absolute pile o drivel. We tried to watch this muck, we tried, to painful. Seriously bad cinema.
10	28 September 2021	karwan_m	Best Netflix show	I have watched a couple of Netflix shows, like Umbrella Academy, Stranger Things, Lupin and La Casa De Papel.But this show, is by far the best.I heard about this show by various pages throughout social media, and from a couple of friends, so I thought, lets give it a try.After the first episode, I was already in love with the show. The show is very bingeworthy.And man, what a great show this was, I hope after that ending a season 2 comes soon.
9	12 October 2021	Jari_V	Very atmospheric show that has something for a wide audience, even when it is a bit predictable	The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season.
10	6 October 2021	natalieralbright	Slow start, but worth watching	I didn't anticipate getting so invested. The beginning of the series was slow for me, still interesting enough that I continued watching. After about the 3rd game, I was hooked. I love this show. The old man and North Korean girl are gems.
10	26 September 2021	laurafayebartle	Amazing!! Korean tv shows are the future	This tv series is so entertaining. I couldn't switch it off, it hit every emotion from shock, tears and wow.A must watch if like gripping tv shows.
2	3 October 2021	kgalgano-17879	Honestly don't know what the fuss is about	Meh. At best. I really don't see why this has become a thing. The dialog is childish, the acting is horrendous, the plot is predictable, the pace is slow, the choices are unrealistic and the story is common. So what's the big deal about this mess?
6	6 October 2021	bithikotsis	Decent but meh	Didn't like the main character, a lot of annoying characters also, I can't believe Koreans behave like this. Had some good scenes but overall it is overrated, ended badly and didn't make me feel they put a lot of work on this. Expected better for 8.3 stars.
9	2 October 2021	kr004	such a brilliant show	Did not really know what to expect going in but my goodness. The acting by the cast was incredible(except for the americans but that's okay they didn't have that big of a role). My goodness the emotional toll this show had on me was phenominal. Tears were shed, hearts were broken, anger was boiling. I rarely finish shows, but the grip this show had on me was unbelievable. I took a sick day from school and spent it binging this show. No regrets. So happy but also sad after watching this show😔 brilliantly made and i love everyone!
7	6 October 2021	prettytwitches	Phenomenal start...	Squid Game tells an intriguing story and is very compelling. It is somewhat disturbing, brutal and fantastical in its storytelling of the class divide in society. Nevertheless, once you start watching you won't be able to stop. Most of the episodes are fantastic and really draw you into the story. The character development and story arcs are pretty solid, and the acting is phenomenal. I was also blown away by the set design, costumes and overall aesthetic. However, there is some plot points that I was not overly fond of. One being the whole organ harvesting side story. I understand that this was here to highlight there was an intruder amongst them but for me it just distracted from the story and overall aesthetic of the show. Another was the 'twist' that Il Nam was behind the whole thing. I could see this a mile off but hoped that because the show had been clever so far it wouldn't fall into this trap. I was left feeling a bit deflated by the scene with him and Seong Gi-Hun at the end. There are also some plot holes that are somewhat frustrating. Like how was Il Nam phoning the Front Man to check in. Especially when some of the other contestants were staying awake all night. Also, when the Front Man goes to check out the washed-up body and finds his brother's badge. Wouldn't he have known that the body was not his brother? Still he goes back to the island like the issue had been handled. I do think that the show could have benefitted from maybe being 10 episodes as the last three feel somewhat rushed and different tonally from the rest of the show. I am also slightly frustrated that we did not find out more about the Front Man, this side of the story is somewhat lacking. I know a lot of people have taken issue with the VIPs acting. However, this did not bother me as it just added to the obnoxious and disgusting personality of these characters. Finally, you will be mystified by Seong Gi-Hun's hairstyle choice at the end, but I believe it is him trying 'start fresh' or trying to take back control of himself after what happened. Kind of like when people get crazy hairstyles after a bad breakup. You will definitely be frustrated by Sae-Byoek's death but again for me it just highlighted that none of the characters, no matter how badass, were in control of what was going to happen. Lastly, you may be annoyed by Seong Gi-Hun's final decision to not get on the plane. However, I think this is showing that he is no longer going to just sit by and watch bad things happen to other people. This is a narrative of his character throughout. We know that he has PTSD from the riots during the protest at his work. Where he sat by and watched someone get killed and again with the drunk guy on the street in the final episode. He could have gone down and helped the guy, but he didn't or maybe the show is just saying that people don't change. Seong Gi-Hun is impulsive. Whatever the reason it is a great Segway for the next season.
9	7 October 2021	ryanvansloun	Recommend	One of the best series i've whatched in a long time.
3	18 September 2021	hobbyfact	Low class series	So boring. Try to be cool but no brain to do.Boring plot. Boring writer.Too drama. No fun. Nothing interesting.All can be is some series that just play and do something else.
8	14 October 2021	piyushkumarsahbgt	Definitely a one time watch	Many parts were predictable but still there were factors increasing curiosity. Won't add which parts were predictable cause I want this spoiler free.The acting by main chars was excellent.
3	9 October 2021	tsabourish	Why all this noise?	Terrible acting, the main idea of the plot is used very much, copy of trends (full body uniforms and masks). I would be much better if it was just a movie. I really don't understand why all this noise globally for this series. Maybe it's the splatter that new age likes?
10	2 October 2021	drlamees-40050	New idea	One of the amazing series I have ever watched, day after day the Korean drama proves to be the best. If you are feeling bored because of repetitive ideas of Hollywood drama just watch Squid Game, the idea is just fresh in the packet, the actors are very capable, even the music is perfect. You can't just simply ignore the next episode, it is like addiction you will continue to watch🤗
10	6 October 2021	iliastrivier	So good!	The series is so good and so emotional it is itself the first series i watched in korean. Highly recommended!
8	9 October 2021	sheikhkaka	Good but why is the hype?	A nice Korean thriller, you will be definately hooked to finish the whole series. But why is it having this much fuss and hype? It is not that good!
5	27 September 2021	graysoncleighton	Full of holes	The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.
10	9 October 2021	devvvanyvonne-74226	GREAT MOVIE!	Really cared about these characters. It really made me attached to this movie. Great storytelling!
3	7 October 2021	harshsinghpn	Doesn't worth the hype	There are a lot better shows out there, doesn't worth the hype. Shows only massacre, no proper story line.
10	19 September 2021	aliitaha	Brilliant! Masterpiece	The details are in every scene. Wish to see another season.
7	9 October 2021	drkne	Good, but not one of the best death game stories. How'd it get so popular?	I've loved death game stories ever since I started reading the Gantz manga back in the early 2000's. Or maybe I watched Battle Royale before that... not sure.I'm something of a gore hound, and enjoy the mixing and intersecting of various character arcs in these extreme situations. Seeing many hit both their bests and their worsts in a short period of time. Some have redemption arcs, some fall from grace and end in shame. It's almost always a fun rollercoaster of emotions.Personally I'd rank this somewhere around the middle of the list for this particular niche genre. I don't quite understand how this one in particular became so popular. I guess that a lot of young people think this is a new concept.As with most visual media I've seen come out of Korea, this has superb cinematography but imo, it falls short a bit in the writing and acting. I vastly prefer the similar Japanese incarnations that stretch all the way to the unflinching, insane (sometimes hoaky) extremes that really embed them in your memory.I didn't like most of the cast and only found 2 characters somewhat likeable, with the rest ranging from vaguely annoying to insufferably annoying. I didn't really find any of them actually relatable.Plus, who's idea was it to cover the face of the most famous (imo hottest) actor they have almost the whole time?! Won't spoil it by saying who.Off the top of my head, I would rank these above Squid Game: Battle Royale I and II, Gantz (manga and movies are good, the anime suuuucks because they made it too early before the first arc was finished in the manga), As the Gods Will, Alice in Borderland, King's Game (anime, haven't seen the movie)
7	13 October 2021	majorasmask-53220	Eh	It was trying too hard to be artsy at times which resulted in it being boring in spots. Majority of it was predictable. My main issue was the reasoning behind all of the games. Yes, they are all in debt and need things paid off. Fair. So what is the reasoning for the mastermind to make all these people play games? He wanted to just have fun. This is lumped in with all the stupid reasons anime shows happen. Because of boredom or they just want to have fun/make things interesting. LAZY.
1	15 October 2021	irfaanenator	Dont waste your time	Even if you have half a brain you will realize this is an over sensationalised piece of garbage that everyone is trying to connect over and prove to their social media fakes that they have watched it.None of the characters had any depth. The best character was still the most irritating and ends up in a murder suicide.The climax is such an anti climax. The games and outcomes are predictable. The person that is made out to be the bad guy is not actually a bad guy, he just understood the game more than the rest of the idiots.I cant feel sorry for anyone or relate to anyone in the show... because the writing is too dumb.0/10 and i would even give it a - rating just because of the over sensationalism over the idiotic show.If there is a 2nd season its a delete for me.
9	10 October 2021	arcizy-50047	Best korean film	The story was unpredictable.Strong character.Little bit gore.There is betrayal, sacrifice, strategy, greed, everything is on this film.Seriously you have to watch this before you die.
6	8 October 2021	kanu-85357	Starts well becomes too predictable by the end	Its about bunch of wealthy bored sadists betting on humans and killing the ones who lose.Story started of well with some goof ups and stupidity but it keeps you engaged.As you reach episode 6, it becomes quite evident who will survive and who won't. There is no explanation to what they do except for sadism and no value of human life.
10	14 October 2021	awaisabbas-92690	THE SERIES IS SERIOUSLY GEM💎	The Best Web Series Ever One Of The Best Series Of The WorLd No 1 this series show world real face must and best experience in my life .................................
6	11 October 2021	remyng-76275	Great psycho triller but movie plot went bad towards the end	The movie started with great plots and provided great anticipation for viewer like me. It keeps your mind thinking what's the game coming next.However everything went south when the VIP appeared.. the movie added some low b-graded westerners with psycho minded which I don't see the connection at all. When they were ushered to the room with naked body paintings, the scenes were so disconnected.Apart from the above, this is a great movie.
7	12 October 2021	goossensm-05392	6 superb episodes, 3 last ones are crap	Started great. Beautiful scenery, surprising, promising. Then came E7 (VIP's)...the worst writing, directing and acting ever! Episodes 8 and 9 are nothing more than a bunch of cliches.Six episodes 10 points each. The last three no more than 1 point. Makes 7 points in total, but never before I watched something that went downhill so badly. If there is a 2nd season, I'll pass.
9	12 October 2021	favianioel-99408	lots of emotions	I watched the show because it was trending and I couldn't stop until I finished it. The idea behind the show is close to Hunger Games or Battle Royale, it's about a game where people die and there is friendship and betrayal, even if you watched hunger games and battle royale this is still new and a very beautiful show that is set apart.The progression of the characters was beautiful, the acting was very good some say the VIP acting and dialog was bad, I didn't like it either but I think the dialog was meant to be stupid and cheezy like real psychopath rich people would have, it's like a separation from normal people and rich people with a sick mind, so if the VIP disturbed you I think that was the director's plan.The show is pleasing to the eye and ears, even if the players were locked in a place every game was in a different setting and was beautifully designed, the tense music during the games makes you anxious, idk... just watch it already !!!
9	27 September 2021	krishnaalexsandro	Hum....	A dangerous man? Great idea. But the VIPs are very poor characters.
10	27 September 2021	xalidwalker	:(	Watch ep 6 and then u will understand why this series is so famous.
6	12 October 2021	kadirkeskin-26105	Amazing visuals paired with mediocre plot	Squid game doesn't deserve half the hype it's getting. As someone who's easily satisfied, the plot is totally off, the actions certain characters decide to make and the whole "fictional realism" is mediocre at best.On the other hand, the visuals, colors and camerawork in general is amazing.
7	10 October 2021	nagymatyas_official	Too many options.	There are people who have watched this series and are happy with it because it entertained them. But we are a few who have seen how many opportunities they have left behind. They could have brought a lot more out of it, instead of a grotesque mindless murdering.
4	6 October 2021	ethancox-83148	I can't see what the fuss is about	Maybe it's because I don't speak Korean and the translation is awful, but I heavily rely on IMDB to dictate the shows that I watch... having said that I cannot understand the hype around this show, I find it painful to watch and this isn't a new concept - games that involve brutally killing people... anyway I'm half way through and purely only watching because I don't want to be "that guy" that hasn't seen the infamous "squid game". But christ on a cracker... its not THAT good.
9	4 October 2021	ramyimam-22140	Almost perfect	Great story, great acting, not giving it a 10 because of the VIPs.Love Korean movies/series (Check out the movie 'Old Boy')
9	22 September 2021	walterwhite-74074	Uncut gems meets parasite meets eyes wide shut meets battle royale meets the platform	Very addictive. The most intense tug of war scene ever. This show will keep you curious, entertained and anxious the whole time. By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching.
9	1 October 2021	tristlar	literally almost perfect	If the vips were done with Korean actors, or at least some people who know how to read off a script, this would be a 10/10 show. In episode 7, the VIPs are front and center, so that inevitably makes it the worst episode by far. This frustrates me even more, because this show was so close to being perfect. Hope the 2nd season (if they decide to make another) will fix these issues.
1	11 October 2021	RareshDiMofte	Enough with these psycho ideas	No, it's not fun to watchNo, it is not entertainingIt is disgusting for the mindAll the crap with awful, silly high school acting.What did they achieve with this? Views? Big deal.Learning something? The opposite...
8	6 October 2021	joshuadawsonbrown	Brilliant Show... but PLEASE watch it in the Korean.	The show is great, well worth a watch. Fantastic concept, brilliantly executed with some stellar acting and directing.But the English dub is.. laughably bad. The show drops from an 8/10 to a generous 5/10 when you watch it on the dub.Ignoring the atrocious acting from the English side of Squid Game, as soon as you switch it back to Korean, it instantly turn back into a beautiful piece of television, appealing to anyone aged 14 or over.An expert on cinema, or a bored Netflix subscriber with nothing else to do; both will enjoy it equally as this is one of the best shows Netflix has released. I would definitely recommend watching. It has some thrilling twists, fabulous performances from the Korean actors, and overall a great story. If you haven't yet - watch Squid Game. And watch it the way it was intended...
7	1 October 2021	ermkaybruv	The first six episodes are gold, and then the glass shatters underneath it	This show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.And then the VIPs came in.Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, "Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with."Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, "This is one of the best scenes in TV history." I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end.
9	2 October 2021	tomandlily-78351	good but one issue	This show is absolutely amazing and i would very highly reccomend it but it has one big flaw in my eye, how did they always set up the perfect amount of chairs and that, i mean in the steak dinner scene, you cant just tell me that they had a triangular table laying around.
1	13 October 2021	garryfiction	Dont understand why this is popular	This is a boring series i really dont understand why it is so popular. Adults playing childrens games but they die if they fail... it dont even sound like a good idea.
3	3 October 2021	julietamussi	Don't waste your time	Extremely bad acting (including the amazing VIP characters - WTF was that?), predictable ending and scenes that dragged on for too long. There is no character development and your don't feel connected to them or their dramas.
8	12 October 2021	mustafijurrahman-27415	Predictable	Good show,few great episode & absolutely rubbish ending.
9	22 September 2021	ricardofilipedaraujo	Great show but disappointing ending	My score should be 8.5, but I will round it up.The bad:Questionable ending which is suggesting a season 2VIPs acting and visit purposePolice substory is lacklusterThe good:Well written and thrilling story inspired by multiple works in this genre, but piecing some of the best of each (Kaiji, Alice in Borderland, etc.)Different perspectives are brought to the table and the story allows the viewers to know a lot of the different characters.Original soundtrack matched the situation quite wellKR actors acting.
7	14 October 2021	abhilashsharma-08137	Last two episodes could have been just one..too lengthy after interval	Its good to watch but ending is absurd...it won't reach any conclusion...overall its a one time watch, there are some characters without a background story.
9	3 October 2021	kaldredpayne	Anime For People Who Haven't Watched Anime	This show is great so far. It has a cool mystery and style BUT the reason I believe it's so popular is because of its anime style concept. This show has an outlandish concept style that isn't popular in typical American media but is very popular in anime. I believe this show is so popular because everyone who loves anime likes the show. Not just that but those who have never seen anime because of stigma but would enjoy the medium LOVE this show because it's the first thing they have seen like it. Everyone is raving about this show because they have never seen anything like it (except for us anime watchers). I believe this show's popularity represents a huge shift in entertainment. I think this will be a gateway for it's fans into other non-American entertainment forms, most specifically anime.
10	13 October 2021	tanmaygotarne	🔥Absolutely Great show!!! Masterpiece 👍	Really a great show with great concept. Every death scene has its own logical situation, great cinematic shots and good story everyone should watch it. Literally Don't listen to those people who are calling this series overrated. Those people are burning because of the overhypeness of this series.must watch series.
3	2 October 2021	belzilm-78244	What a stupid show and horrible translation	This is an Over acted and stupid show. You just don't care about the characters and it's all over the place. Also this is a re ash of so many other movies and nothing original. Finally the English translation voice over is just horrible.
10	9 October 2021	nasirshael	"SQUID GAME: A LEGENDARY SERIES"	SQUID GAME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WEB SERIES IN THE WORLD. THIS WEB SERIES IS INCREDIBLE & LEGENDARY. ALL OF YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS ONCE. LITERALLY ALL THE EPISODES ARE BEST OF THE BEST. YOU WILL GET EMOTIONAL,THRILLED,EXCITED & BREATHE TAKING AT THE SAME TIME.IT'S A TOTAL FASCINATION. I AM OBSESSED IN IT. I AM WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. ALL THE ACTORS & ACTRESS WERE AMAZING.ACTUALLY "LEE JUNG-JAE" HIS ACTING WAS TOO REALISTIC. IT WAS THE BEST CHARACTER. INFINITE SALUTE TO THE DIRECTOR "HWANG DONG-HYUK" FOR GIVING US THIS OUTSTANDING WEB SERIES. THE ENDING OF SQUID GAME IS VERY TWISTING & ASTOUNDING.OF COURSE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC WAS TOO MUCH THRILLING."HONEY COMB" PART WILL BE MEMORABLE FOREVER. ON THE OTHER SIDE "GGANBU" PART WAS TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL & PAINFUL.SO, GUYS WATCH SQUID GAME ONCE BEFORE YOU DIE.WAITING FOR "SQUID GAME: SEASON 2"... ... ...
3	10 October 2021	elianasaar	Overrated and predictable	This show is very overrated. Had to push through the series not binge-worthy at all. The whole storyline is predictable and I'm entertaining since nothing is actually surprising in the plot. Really don't understand the hype. The only entertaining part are watching how elegant the games are put together and the shots of them dying are very well done.
10	26 September 2021	spirittaffy	Very Fun a great Binge	Here is why we wanted to say about Squid Game. I miss movies and shows like this. We haven't had anything similar for awhile. I thought the character development was top notch. I seriously cared about 8 characters. This made it fun because I had no idea who would die or win. All of the characters are flawed. There wasn't a typical hero or someone you really hated and I loved that. The acting was really really good for several characters. The directing and writing was really good. It was exciting and fun with lots of twists and turns. The concept was pretty cool and you could do sequels and it would be just as fun as long as you can find more actors as great as these. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will probably really like this series. My husband said it was a cross between Saw, Hunger Games and the minions (only for the outfits). I haven't seen Saw and don't like torture, but I enjoyed this. However, if you are not cool with lots of people dying you might think it's too much. Also, we all binged the season in two days and are still like wait a minute? I was thinking about this and wow, is this what really happened? Enjoy!
9	22 September 2021	abhibhaluari	One of the Best web Series	No doubt it is a one of the Best web Series. I recommend everyone to watch this.
10	23 September 2021	eastbroadwayrb	All You Need Is Episode 1 ....	.... And it'll do its job. The games gave me anxiety and goosebumps. Definitely worth watching a few episodes at a time.
10	30 September 2021	yathishkumar-03198	Worth A watch	This Series shows the Real life financial crisis and debts and giving the worth through a game which is death or alive worth a watch.
4	10 October 2021	1dfazio1	Overblown	Good plot but could have been wrapped up in half the episodes. Some of the acting is atrocious. Just don't understand these ratings.
1	9 October 2021	glenmale	Awful	The worst acting in the history of TV/film.Just plain awful. I would rather eat a 2 metre mound of dog excrement than sit through another ep of this tripe.
9	24 September 2021	cjscctv	Entertaining.	The title of the movie is a little strange, but it is not surprising cuz most Korean movies have weird titles. However, it is quite entertaining, immersive, and highly addictive. Is season 2 going to be an octopus game?
8	1 October 2021	paytrader	Well done!	Many reviewers have commented on the "horrible acting" of the VIPs. I sense their lack of emotion is intentional. It is indicative of their lack of normal human empathy.Overall I found the story to be interesting and that the story compelled me to continue watching through to the end. In that regard, the production was well done.The conclusion and theme is not anything that I can praise however. Life is not purposeless nor is everyone bad and lacking in virtue. I have viewed so many Asian films that purport to say "life is futile".Life is worth living. Life has meaning. That is my hope and faith. So I stand against the theme of the production but I found it interesting and entertaining. Entertainment is its only value.
9	1 October 2021	rishabhhi	Everything Perfect, almost!	What a brilliant show, keeps you on the edge & delivers one last unexpected blow towards to the end! Everything perfect, except the obnoxious portrayal of the western VIP's! Had that been replaced by Korean actors, it would've been 10/10! Well done, Netflix!
10	8 October 2021	aakashgawde	Real picture of Human beings	This web series shows the real portrayed of human beings..
1	9 October 2021	gabrielafp	Disturbing	The fact that Squid Game is the #1 series in the World right now helps explain a lot when it comes to the fact that everyone seems to be mentally disturbed these days.Interesting and fast-paced series, yes. But VERY disturbing.
6	7 October 2021	NewBollywoodCritic	Episodes don't line up. Wasteful build up.	The timeline of Ep. 6- Gganbu and Ep. 7-VIP did not match. By the time VIPs arrive, the old man was killed playing marbles. In the last episode its revealed that old man wants to play and not host. Play what? He's already "dead" for the participants.Anyway, first couple of episodes were good and at multiple times the scenes were over stretched. Many elements and much of the build up was left hanging. The cop who chased the perpetrators the whole time, dies inconsequentially. No follow up on the messages sent to the cops (he even talked with his chief).Perhaps, the English translation and subtitles failed to deliver the story in true essence and that's why emotions and behaviors seemed unjustified.
9	16 October 2021	gxp-85709	What a show! VIPS were dusty though	Loved it! Great performances from all leads and finishes on a brilliantly written cliff hanger. Twists and turns are all welcomed too. Fantastically choreographed action sequences, and I cannot wait for season 2.
5	20 September 2021	ibensbnd	Promosinf at the beginning, disappointing at the end.	This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying.
10	1 October 2021	danielkol-58244	Great !	It was so intresting that i finished all in 1 day.
5	6 October 2021	jplummer-73906	Rubbish.	So overhyped. The games were good, don't get me wrong, but literally everything else was awful. Dialogue boring, it dragged so much. Pointless and predictable storylines, lots wrong with it. Honestly couldn't wait til it ended. And even the ending annoyed me.
10	29 September 2021	smokiesfriend	VIP or Not VIP that is the question	I can't say this is a "spoiler alert" because everyone else is harping on the subject.Many people reviewing this series are hung up on how well the "VIPs" can act. Think of it another way, can they just be ordinary people whom just come on for a "guest" appearance? Do they actually have to act?Remember the "rich" people of the world are self centered and don't really care if one is injured or not. Why would they want to have lines that actually mean something?
8	26 September 2021	brooksayre	Great show but that one really annoying character	I have to write this, because I love the show. Interesting plot and executed pretty well. I also love how your able to be both sides. If this was like most shows and movies, the red people would be a mystery that you never get to know about, but I love how this dives into the red characters side too. Most of the show is great but, it's that stinking Korean girl, the one who talks loud and annoying, got banged by the one mob dude, and carries cigs around (I don't remember her name). I get the show needs to make annoying characters, but she's soooo annoying i literally can't stand her scenes in the show. Y'all didn't create a character that made it difficult for the other characters to get work with, you made a character difficult for the viewers of the show to watch the show. But other than that love the show.
9	5 October 2021	itsanamariahere	A whole nother level of deadly-game dramas	What makes Squid Game different from other dramas within the "deadly games" genre:1) The games are simple and easy to understand. If I were in Kakegurui or Liar Game, I wouldn't even fully understand the rules of the games, much less thing of an ingenious plan that takes advantage of god knows what loophole.2) The characters and situations are realistic. There is no cartoonish trope. They all behave like normal, average people, while still having their own unique personalities.3) There is no mastermind player with IQ 3000 who is always 11 steps ahead of the other characters.4) The characters chose to be part of the game even after its cruelty was unraveled, making it all the more disturbing.5) It put South Korea as a country in a bad light. I was shocked when Sae-Byeok basically said the South is not that much better than the North.My only complaint is that Squid Game doesn't escape the "kill all the main characters except for the protagonist" trope present in other k-dramas such as Sweet Home. Also, I feel like they could've expanded more on the relationship between Sae-Byeok and Ji-Yeong, building more on it before it all came crumbling to dust.
9	18 October 2021	harrybreese-04409	Well worth a watch	Really great show. Story driven and well acted. The VIPs are the reason for loss of a star, horrible acting by them. Otherwise, give in to the hype, I watched the whole thing in a weekend.
2	12 October 2021	chocolateshortcakewithvanilla	Overrated	Well, this is just a Korean Hype. Japanese thriller like As A Gods Will, Alice in Borderland, Battle Royale 1&2 are better than this.
2	28 September 2021	rtcprafu	So overrated	Is it realistic? This game invented in 1988. Every year so many people disappear and their body never found. Why is the police thinks main role is like crazy dude. And the banks is a joke? So much potholes and predictable dialogues, actions. Meaningless deaths who bet on the who can shape their candy without break.
4	26 September 2021	chaihoon-18422	Overrated	There are a bunch of much older Japanese dramas & films of this genre (survival games) that are far superior but less popular. Talk about marketing and promotion...
9	2 October 2021	haileyknowles-52150	Love it	Amazing show, even the background characters had great acting- but the VIPs, I hope they don't return again for Season two because their acting was rubbish!
9	17 October 2021	haileyknowles-52150	Good	I would give it a 10 if it weren't for the terrible performance of the VIPs! It killed the vibe. Other than that, every actor or actress gave the performance of a lifetime, costumes are beautiful and well made, and the detail in each scene is fabulous!!!
3	24 September 2021	tejw-34416	Beautiful and unpleasant	The Escher sets and the island hideaway that could have come from the Pinewood 007 stage are memorable but the programme is sunk by ithe moral vacuum at its core.SPOILERS ABOUND BELOWHundreds are despatched as so much deadwood so that we can have meaningful encounters with those granted speaking parts and they in turn dutifully expire so that the supposedly morally conflicted main character can feel a bit upset and buy off his complicity in the slaughter by chucking shedloads of his winnings at the sole dependent of one of the 400+ victims. Yes, he does look morose and affects appropriate hair growth to the point where he really must be saddened by the whole unpleasantness and even goes as far as having a salon dye his hair red (and do a terrible job at the rear - if you take away anything from this drama it is to ensure you get them to use a mirror to show you the back if you visit a barber in Korea).The contortions of probability required to support the reveal of the old man as the kingpin of the enterprise point to a rethinking of the physical world more radical than that proposed by Einstein and the logistics and financing of the operation are underpinned by no more than the fact that someone conceived of them in an idle moment and never troubled themselves to give it a second thought.The second series is a slam dunk but I'll follow the example of the few who chose not to return to the game - life outside may not always be a bed of roses but returning to the unpleasant stench of this narrative is a far worse proposition.
10	2 October 2021	chiff-31273	excellent	Oh no! How so ... The main characters are no longer made the most intelligent and strong, they have added humanity, and even without tolerance, what a horror ... But seriously, an excellent series, this is what modern cinema lacks.
9	28 September 2021	bethelast	**MINDBLOWING**	The series started off with a bang and it just hooked me from the very starting 1st episode and I binge-watched the whole show in 1 day.IT'S ENGAGING,VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND THE CHARECTERIZATION OF THE PLAYERS WERE ASLO GOOD. Though it's not a masterpiece but it's an unique take on this interesting concept. AND, ALSO I loved the CLIMAX TWIST.WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL OF YOU GUYS!!
3	11 October 2021	bakryork	Bafflingly bad acting.	Nobody believes in themselves.More precisely, no actor seems to ever get out of their own head. Makes you wonder if it's all Korean actors, or just these particular Korean actors, who've never learned the art of losing themselves in their character. Every word, movement, expression is a reminder that you're watching actors in costumes on a set reciting lines in front of a camera.My suggestion: get a hold of the script and read it. In this way, I'm thinking, the story might have a chance to come alive-as something more than a series of sketches put on by a bunch of clowns.
10	1 October 2021	yoshijacobe	I want a second, a third and a fourth season please!!	One of the best shows I've ever watched, I hate the VIPs though.
10	10 October 2021	acplegalsuite	A masterpiece. Gore is secondary.	You can't compare this show to Battle Royale, Saw, Kill Bill, Hostel, Hunger Games. No way.READ ON.Hunger Games - which was made so cheesy, even the name 'Katnis Evergreen' is so Cringey for the genre is NOTHING like Squid Game. I learn nothing from Hunger Games and the acting/emotions of the characters are not believable. The contestants are too polished without any flair to project a torturous situation - mental and physical. The whole picture is a clown fest and the moment the contestants are unleashed to battle for survival, the show turned from boring to purposeless. I felt nothing from the show. Other brutal shows above are all about senseless killings too. If at all comparing the above shows, Squid Game is perhaps closest to Saw, of which the latter has quite an interesting concept but still boring.Does not mean you release a film about plane crash, you own the genre. SQUID GAME is an ORIGINAL survival show and Hollywood just have to admit it.Also, SQUID GAME is at a complete different skill level, in terms of performance and writing. The character development is genius, and the planting of clues and planned coincidences is mind blowing. The gore is just secondary, and the whole heart of the show is completely something else - next level entertainment.Watching this show inspires me to be compassionate, and I am not inspired at all by the violence. Those who wishes not to see the show just because it's rated to include violent scenes, will just be at loss.
1	21 September 2021	kelemandejan	Just bad	Keeps you excited, interesting twists and turns throughout the series. And then, then one of the worst and ridiculous endings ever. Last episode destroyed somewhat decent series.
10	3 October 2021	MrDB84	Loved it!	Usually I hear about a hyped up show.. Watch a episode or two and feel let down but not here!Squid Game is special... I've recently seen it compared to Alice In Borderland and I must say Squid Game is far superior for the storyline, character development and eerie message of what lengths human beings will go to for money when feeling desperate.The only moment I questioned the show was during the first half of episode 2 which slowed down a bit but picked up again within the second half.After that I was glued to it and by the end I was left hoping for a season 2.
1	5 October 2021	yvmznkb	Boring, predictable and a bad rip-off of Hunger games and Saw series.	I fast forwarded it after episode 4. Didn't have the time and energy to go through each and every boring scene of this show just to know the ending. Shouldn't have listened to my friend whi said its a great show.
8	5 October 2021	colinandmartin	Episodes 1-6 were great. The rest weren't	The first 6 episodes had me questioning whether this show was a masterpiece and one of Netflix's best pieces. Everything from the acting to the cinematography to the writing was incredible and really dragged u into this world in which there was no escape. And then I watched episode 7. The VIPs were awful and served no purpose to the story what so ever and seemed like a waste of time with cringe humour and simply bad acting. The episode 7 game was also taken straight from "kaiji" an anime. They attempted to cram so many plot twits and turns to the point where it wore down the finale so much it was boring to watch. The main plot twist was incredibly predictable and honestly if it had a simpler ending it would be an easy 10/10 and one of the best Netflix shows they've put out ever. I do recommend it but by the end you don't really care about the lead character and it just feels odd (not in a good way). This show was so close to being an absolute bombardment of genius tv show making but the last few episodes took that title away. All in all a solid show but just a bad ending. It doesn't ruin the show it's just annoying to see such a brilliant show take such an awful ending.
9	6 October 2021	wcddg	Really great show with a few minor hiccups..	I loved the show and binged it through in one night. Great acting of the main characters. So all in all a great show, that was very emotional at times and had me on the edge of my seat. The show plays with a lot of moral dilemmas as well as drawing a critical portrait of the structural injustices of late capitalism, as well as the arrogance and misanthrophy of the super rich.Only a couple things in the plot were a bit sloppy / confusing:1) The cop - he manages to get in there and move around unseen for that long with cameras everywhere? When he's alone with the VIP and leaves him unconscious and naked - how on earth does that not bother / alarm the other VIPs? Shouldn't they be up in arms? And then his missing brother is actually working as a sort of head operator for the game despite only being missing for a short while? Why does the brother shoot him dead off that cliff, literal seconds after telling him he wouldn't do that and after telling his men to bring him in alive? Seemed so pointless. So many questionmarks and I feel there was room to play it out differently.2) The way the players behaved during the game. It was abundantly clear that this was a "winner takes it all" scenario, meaning only one would get out alive and win the prize. What on earth was going on with all the bonding and trying to "get out together"? And then in the next moment they were all over each other killing each other with their bare hands over some missed food rations. It did add to the drama and definitely worked for the character development, but this seemed a bit random.3) The vote / return to the game. When they first voted to end the game, the old guy actually decided the vote with his vote. Why on earth would he do that. Just to motivate the players by going back to their old lives, to come back on their own accord? Seems an awful lot of extra risk and effort, having all these people back in the real world after the atrocities they have just witnessed. Also he had shared with the other players that he had a brain tumor and was dying, it would have made all the sense in the world, had he chosen to continue.Then they said: we will split the money among the families of the deceased. When the players returned, the money was still there.3) The VIPs poor / clichée acting and demeanor. Maybe it was actually intended, as the whole show is a parable for the injustices of late capitalism, which then again, apparently went over so many heads that it's not even funny anymore. "They were there voluntarily, right?" "See what bad choices lead to?" - No, it's a structural problem that made these people so desperate that a life and death murder game seemed like the more viable option than trying their best in the free world. How anyone can see that as their own fault and not see how the system is designed to exploit the vast majority of people into debt slavery while the 1% are so bored they literally start killing people for fun - well that is entirely beyond me. I wish more people would understand this not-so-subtle subtext of the show.4) The prize. I was actually surprised the winner even got the prize money in the end (and apparently there are no tax authorities in south korea) and they let him go, knowing what he knows. But even more surprising: Did the main character not have 4 million debt with some gangsters who were out for his blood? How could he have "gone back to his old life" in his neighbourhood for a full year - and not have touched the prize money - without at least paying off his debt?Still loved it.
8	27 September 2021	mayaajey	It was really good!	It was a very good series, I really enjoyed it! I do like this type of genre so I was looking forward to watch it! I think that the plot was entertaining and I also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as Money Heist (the guys wearing red suits) or Star Wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like Darth Vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which I didn't mind. I also noticed that the series is pretty similar to Hunger Games and Alice in Borderland on different aspects but I still find it unique and interesting. I didn't mind the VIP acting tbh, I've seen worse and that was ok. However there is one thing that I would have changed. I would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and I guess more 'bossy'. Idk but I felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. I remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) Are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? It just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. That's my opinion tho, It's not that big of a deal. The rest was good!Again I liked the plot, I liked the characters and the writing was good. Yes there are things that I didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? Just like that?? What was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? And there is moreHowever I did enjoy the series and I can't wait for the next season.
8	10 October 2021	ba-80642	Finale kinda ruined it for me	Up to Episode 6 This show was near perfect, every aspect of it was extremely enjoyable, the pacing kept you hooked while not making everything feel unnatural, the acting was realistic and everyone really stayed true to their character, the filming was really enjoyable and it gave you a great way to see stuff, then with episode 7, they introduced american vips, now don't get me wrong they definitely didn't have good acting, but i will give them credit for really being emotionless and portraying what kind of people they are supposed to be, plus they didn't take much from the plot so i didn't care too much for them, and finally the 5th game on the 7th episode was arguably my favorite, so i enjoyed that too, episode 8 wasn't bad in terms of anything but plotting, you follow up with the cop the entire show just for him to be killed by his brother who is for some reason the front man who also won the game a few years back, it really doesn't make sense, doesn't add to the show, and doesn't have a backstory to rest on, but again that's kind of a side story which shouldn't interfere with the main story and the main character's story, so the finale must be great? Right? Not really, the finale starts off okay with the final game but the writing feels extremely off, everyone breaks character, there isn't much story progression, and the worst thing, the old man is behind it all, for some reason the old man (001) is the one who started and made the game because he was too rich, this would've been an okay story if he didn't take part in the game and have his character built off being a poor old man risking it all, because he wouldn't actually die, we also see the main character ( assumably ) try to seek revenge instead of going to get custody of his daughter, which's a major way for Netflix to milk the show by leaving it on a cliffhanger and probably making a second season, i hope they can find a way to make the second season somehow good, but there isn't much to do, he'll just, seek revenge? Then it's over, nothing else to do, other than get his life back in order, which should've been part of the finale, however i have to give credit to this show for consistently having great acting and filming, which's why i think it deserves an 8 regardless of the abysmal choices they took after episode 6.
9	5 October 2021	fqbalk	ONE OF THE BEST SERIES... but what are those VIPS?	I absolutely love this series, but what are those VIPS? Their acting is soooo cringe.
10	18 September 2021	shelovesme-43178	Way too good	I loved the way the entire drama revolves around the true nature of humans. At every stage this drama never stops to surprise you. Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.I want to remove my memories and watch this again.
9	17 October 2021	callmejohnny	Binge worthy	I'm not quite sure why it's as great as it is , but I watched it all in two days. I couldn't get enough. It was so different and you get so involved with the characters. Very well done.
10	30 September 2021	rahmatarifian	AMAZING SERIES	The best series television on netflix. Please prepare for SEASON TWO i,am wait..
10	2 October 2021	kwrgtv	Amazing	Amazing series definitely recommend. To watch. Perfect.
8	24 September 2021	awfilmmaker	Captivating throughout! Never a dull moment	This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended.
10	6 October 2021	artiraman-90142	Amazing web series this webseries deserve everything	I think in my whole life this web series is best means squid game has everything emotion, suspense, thriller, action and more I love this show and i am waiting for season 2.
8	17 September 2021	dzzygurl	Great show	This is only my second review. I binged this all in one day and loved it. I still like Alice in Borderland better but was a great show. Can't wait for a new season and to see what happens next.
10	21 September 2021	mhamddaqqaa	Wow	Woow. Am shocked! Amazing sereies. Defined beauty.
8	21 September 2021	elystonhayden-19893	Binged! Please don't remake and ruin	Best Netflix show I've seen for awhile. Had echoes of Spanish film The Platform (2019) and of course The Hunger Games films.Hard on their luck people pushed down and controlled by the top feeders of society, are approached to play a game to win the big bucks and get out of the current holes they have found themselves in.And what a thrilling edge of your seat ride this makes for viewing. Unknown masked dictators are hosting a game-show of sorts were the players (In debt everyday people) are desperate to win the cash even if it costs them their lives.Lots of twists and some deeper observations on humanity follow. Just a warning it's very violent and a bit trippy, so if that's not your thang obvs avoid. It also reminded me of the human sport elements in Eli Roth's Hostel and James Wan's Saw franchise so yes it's out there.Will become a future cult classic and Korean cinema is having a golden moment after masterpieces like Parasite and The Handmaid. Squid Game's hyper realism is pretty visionary stuff for Netflix's typically bland output. Fly me to the moon 8/10.
10	3 October 2021	clairesimpson-73580	Wow	This is definitely worth a watch! Something different and if you like the shock factor and a good bit of gore this is for you..Episode 6 was quite emotional..All in all worth a binge ..
6	11 October 2021	jimmyliaiesecscau	Redundant conversations, buggy plots	Watched this tv show cos It's well-received recently, but I don't find it really captivating and engrossing for some reason.1. The whole story is proceeding at a very slow pace, and there's too much redundant conversation between characters that provide no important information. Personally speaking, I prefer shows with shortcut conversations that either give out information for the latter episodes or are necessary for portraying the characters.2. illogical and buggy sometimes. In the beginning, it states like the money will accumulate as people die, and 1 person equals 10 million South Korean won, but how come the leading actor receives 456 won while only 455 died? I don't get it.
7	1 October 2021	saderaw	wontherfull	Money the orginall story of this serieyou can enjoy,cry,lought and.

10	29 September 2021	deborayim	Ppl complaining about VIPs are hilarious to me	All these caucasians complaining about the VIPs about their accent or their oddly scripted lines are hilarious to me. I mean hollywood has been doing this to asians for decades, guess everyone feels weird now that it is happening in reverse. For example, Hiring different asian person to play a specific role about a specific asian nationality, hiring white ppl to play asian characters. Not even really learning the correct language or bother to learn the correct pronunciations of their lines. Or even write them a proper line in their own language in a show or a movie. Or forcing asian actors to have an asian accent when the said actor does not actually have one. I guess decades of watching random ppl portraying asians in some gibberish accent has always made me cringe. Now everyone gets to experience it as well hahaha.
7	11 October 2021	xingliuhit	It's okay	It is attractive, but it is not a very good story.
7	11 October 2021	xingliuhit	Not very good	It is not very good, but it is attractive at first.
8	30 September 2021	noahfawbush	Barely fell short of being a masterpiece	To start, I can confidently say that Squid Game is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. The plot is near perfectly done, the games keep you on the edge of your seat, and the characters are entertaining. There's not many negative things I can say about Squid Game, but there are 3 main gripes that bothered me the whole way through:1.) The characters are naive. Through the game, players often teamed up and vowed that they would win the game together and split the money. However, the game master made it clearly known that there could only be one winner, yet the characters keep making plans to win the game together.2.) The VIP actors are some of the worst I've ever seen. Their acting was so atrocious, it made the movie feel less like a dark, twisted thriller and more of a parody. What few moments they were on the screen warrants removing a star by itself.3.) Gi-Hun won the game for no reason. After winning the final challenge and ultimately watching his best friend die in the process, Gi-Hun is returned to his home town with the enormous cash prize. He doesn't touch the money and spends an entire year getting drunk. When he finally comes back to his senses and decides to go see his daughter, he learns that the game is still alive and we're left with the inclination that he'll try to end it in the predictable season 2. (The red hair was stupid too)Overall, the series was well done and binge worthy without a doubt. I just hope they don't ruin Squid Game's legacy by putting out a disappointing sequel series.
2	30 September 2021	hannahmin-23223	Not worth the hype	I was so excited to watch it at first Bcz it was so popular but when I watch it, it was so boring and makes no sense. I watch it the end btw. The story line was also stupid. It was only popular Bcz the actors and the actresses r pretty and all. It's basically abt playing a game for 45.6 billion dollars and if u join the game u can't quit. And if u quit u will be eliminated. And if u don't follow the game rules u will be eliminated too. Eliminated means u will get shot by these guys from the game and they don't show their identity and hide behind the mask. So umm yea there r sm other k dramas who deserve more hype like the penthouse, hotel del luna, sweet home etc.
2	30 September 2021	hninyeeaye	Overrated asf	The show is so popular for what? It isn't even that good. The story line was poor and the plot twist too. It also make no sense at all. It was only popular Bcz it's on Netflix and the actor Wi ha joon and hoyeon jong r pretty and hot. Theire acting isn't bad but not the best. I watch it till the end and at first it wasn't that bad and it could've been better but it just got worse. There r sm k dramas that deserve more hype like sweet home, the penthouse, hotel del luna etc.
9	1 October 2021	nimaxtv	Good story but bad ..	I think vips act was terrible and they accents was little weird but the players act was fantastic. And i think the ep 2 was boring a little bit for me.
7	1 October 2021	alwayscutepipi	not good but not bad either	The gameplay in the film is very interesting and challenging, but the execution at the end feels lacking.
7	1 October 2021	alwayscutepipi	well	In this story i don't feel the 'plot twist'. Which makes this story good in the acting of the players!
7	2 October 2021	kainacesar-65387	Nice	Nice but actors and actress asian is so horribles.......
9	3 October 2021	badieiamirali	What do you don't miss your birthday	Sorry for all my troubles and thank you don't worry about your.
8	4 October 2021	oussamamhennaouicom	Good	Good story and good caracter developpementI like it.
8	6 October 2021	lukeingram-45836	Pretty dang good	This was... actually kind of good. Well, most of it. The show had great twists and made me kinda sad but there was one problem... the vip's. They were so cringey and the dub for the show in general was hilariously awful. But apart from that, I recommend it greatly.
9	7 October 2021	ayan-20863	It's a Zero Sum Game	You are winning because someone is losing. The same thing happening in our practical life. This series is similar to our real life. You own a house, a car, a good life because someone couldn't afford it on the other side. You must watch this show.
10	7 October 2021	jesswhite-55511	Amazing	Absolutely loved this series but was a little disappointed with the last episode.Would definitely recommend and hoping for a series 2.
6	8 October 2021	segunfaozan	A great movie	Squid game is a great movie, definitely fun to watch but had it's downs. Great story, great acting, but could have been way better and could have had a better twist.
7	9 October 2021	Ozan_39476	blabla	Original concept but the final couldnt made me satisfy.
8	10 October 2021	mmh-84665	Squid Game Review	At first, I wasnt really into this show until I got further into the season and then I was left disoriented. However, it is a very good show in my opinion and I loved it overall. I love the cast and the display of emotions in this show. You can tell that a lot was put into this show and it just drew me in even more.
5	12 October 2021	queenhiyahiya	Confusing drama like this can get an award?	Drama seems exaggerated, I don't know what is discussed here. Comedy, action, betrayal and sex elements put together so I'm confused about which genre to focus on first. It's a mess to be honest.The drama is rather predictable, there is an element of surprise in this drama but not all of it.I loved episode 7, it's really cool. But nothing else, because I don't think so. How can acting and dramas like this become a historical drama netflik in 83 countries can even be called worldwide history.But this story can show some addictive scenes, I like it. Watching this is addictive, and makes me curious at least.
1	13 October 2021	irfanirf-82032	Overrated	No story no script no emotion actors are really good this series made for children overrated series there is no goosebumps movement actors are brilliantly worked in low story bases series.
5	18 October 2021	sandaga-42624	Decent.	It's not a bad show; there's certainly worse ones there (ehem the 100, ehem riverdale), but the concept isn't original, the acting/execution doesn't look different from any other decent tv show, and the only thing that makes it stand out to some extent is the exceptional cinematography. At the end of the day, there are worse shows to spend your time on, and if you have 8-9 hours to kill, Squid Game can do the trick.Midnight Mass by Mike Flanagan was better though.
9	16 October 2021	rahmigvonriva	Very thrilling and exiting show with good plot twists	Every episode is exiting and filled with good plot.Acting seems very realistic. The show is also unpredicteble. Many plot twists and different story lines. I liked this a lot.
10	16 October 2021	BunBunBunBun	All-around game	I fell into this rabbit hole of Korean shows last two years. Certainly Squid Game is the top on my best show list.Why? I don't know. You try it and tell me.I kept thinking of this show so randomly. I am sure many of you are the same. Among Korean shows, Monster (2021) presents no doubt the best quality in every aspect but I didn't live with it over weeks. In this "survival game" genre, Battle Royal or Hunger Game was only made into my okay list.Perhaps, knitted netted symbolism through the series. Perhaps, the beautiful art direction. Perhaps, annoying but relatable characters. Perhaps, the arching heart-breaking.It's a total gift.
10	17 October 2021	deeplearningaichip	I want season 2	I actually binge watched the whole series in 2 days. It's that good to keep me wanting to know what happens next. 😋 I hope they make season 2 because is a really well made series. It's unpredictable in that you cannot quite figure everything out. You feel like one of the contestants and feel their surprise and nerves as they try to survive the challenge. I give this series ten stars since it really deserves it. ❤
10	17 October 2021	aditigrgart	Brilliant	This is a beautifully casted, acted and written show. Brilliant.I watch many Korean series and all of them are amazing but this one tops them all. Koreans have done again. Once you start, you will not stop until its finished, thats what happened with me.
7	12 October 2021	mcturan	Over-rated. Not a woow serie.	Honestly I didn't see a really original, uniq scenario. It was like a combination of different previous movies. I think Netflix users are really desperately waiting a good serie and when they find "not terrible one" , they think it is great. For sure we can't deny the quality of acting of main characters (not all) also should int be denied some parts of scenario was like written by a high school teenager.Let's say "it was not a waste of time" but i don't think anyone will wstch over and over again. Just a one night stand serie.
9	30 September 2021	RealityGal	Wow! Jaw dropping scenes left and right. 👍🏼	This Korean series was brilliant and quite shocking in so many ways. It has lots of very unique violent scenes that at times I found myself stunned for a moment but loving every second of how this show pulls you in. You can really feel for so many of the characters and I found myself really rooting for my favorites but knowing in the back of my head that they will all probably die in this crazy life or death game one after another until it reaches the winner. Episode 6 Gganbu is so mind blowing and heartbreaking. I'm sincerely hoping we get a season 2. We need more squid games minus the ridiculous VIP's or at least get them to speak like an actual human being would. Geez! That is the only reason I didn't give this rating a 9.
10	28 September 2021	TrunksBriefs	Squid Game knew the assignment.	Squid Game has an interesting plot that hooks you on the first episode. The rules of the show is ever changing though with surprises on each entry. How far would you be willing to go to play the game?
9	18 October 2021	onerozdilmen	Original gift from South Korea - thank u!	Finally we get to watch something original. Minimum amount of cliche vs the other netflix series... Nerve-wracking games are so interesting to watch. Needless to say there is a lot of blood that Q Tarantino would be jelaous... SPOILER: "we will die together..."
7	13 October 2021	frankyvertriest	Not worth the hype: sloppy characters	It was fun to watch, had some unexpected games, except of course for the squid game in the end. We all saw that one coming, right?The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of character development... I don't understand the main character. He exactly knows what he gets into when he re-enters the game. Still he is frozen all the time with guilt and pity. When he wins, he does nothing with the money for a year? He keeps on neglecting his daughter, and the little orphan brother till the bizar Christmas scene in the end.. Next season he will go jack Bauer on their asses..The show was full of sloppy characters like 'Han Mi-nyeo': the lady from the sex scene. I didn't care about her at all, but she was one of the most interesting characters. She would do anything to survive: fuck, kill, smuggle,... What made her like that? The fact that she committed suicide (something completely against her instincts), could have been an amazing moment, but it was not..
8	20 September 2021	mr_baiga	Gripping and Exciting....	Great to watch this series. The story was gripping and the acting was exciting... except for the VIPs who came in the last couple of episode. They could have done better.At times I felt that dialogues were a bit too long but you have to complete the time slot. The lead actors were great in their roles.
1	16 October 2021	shevonne876	Rubbish, trash	What was entertaining about it? Nothing. Beilko Experiment and Escape Room is way better. What was supposed to be some comedic scenes was blah to me. There was so many cliches, it wasn't horribly written just produced poorly in my opinion. The only good thing I can say about it that I didn't need to read any subtitles. It's a waste of time. I honestly can't think of one scene that was a little entertaining. The last episode was even worse. I really hope Netflix doesn't renew this nonsense because of the hype.
9	15 October 2021	deeploydodd	Just	Platform + 120 days of Sodom + Eyes wide shut = Squid Game for me.I don't know what I was waiting in the end but I'm kind of disappointed, espacially by the last decision he made.
9	29 September 2021	mvanlaerhoven	Original and creative; go watch it!	I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it.
2	29 September 2021	fitnessmandave	Last episode major let down	Series was tracking as a solid 7 or 8 prior to the last episode. All of the finishing 'revalations' and gotchas were just plain stupid and not needed. Otherwise great upto that point.
10	10 October 2021	herbsharpe60	GREAT	Thank goodness for Netflix, Korean TV production, and the SQUID GAME. Thoughtful, captivating, engaging. Although the first 2/3 of the first episode were almost boring, the last 1/3 of the first episode hooked me for the rest of the series. Episodes 1 - 9 were all great. I sincerely wish more American TV and storytelling were like this. I also hope that nothing further is done with this. Anything more would spoil what it is.
9	24 September 2021	angelica6714	Worth a watch.	This was well written, acted, executed. VIPs played their role. I don't know what people wanted from their screen time. Overall great show. Some scenes felt drawn out from time to time, but other than that. Great show.
8	11 October 2021	GGaia	8.5/10	Only because i hated the americans. Worst part of the story, unnecessary distraction + terrible acting.I was right since the beginning, but I really don't care. I don't care if some things where predictable, it didn't ruin the series for me. GREAT STORY/IDEA (except foe the americans part) SUPERB writting + great acting (except for those stupid americans) .
8	16 October 2021	mo-mo-90	Excellent	Well written, excellent dialogue and all tied together very well, the humour keeps it from being too depressing or gruesome and the acting, pace and the way it was shot all comes together really well for an excellent watch.
6	18 October 2021	Davidpavlovicdp	Does not live up to the hype	To begin I need to say the show is lower mediocre.Actors performances are patheticly boring as if they were trying to convince themselves that their acting is right. They did not convince me at all. Especialy the main characters seem like hobby actors to me.Plot is so flawed that by the episode 5 is does not come together already and plus is so predictable that you can guess whats coming pretty much all the time if you use your brain a bit.The whole idea and mesaage of the show (the indebted society we live in) is not groundbreaking either for it has been depicted in far better titles than this one.My personal opinion is that netflix had to hype up some of their show already because of the poor production they have had in past 2 years and so they finaly decided to heavily market one of their shows and they did bet on this one because its different from anything else most people seen. Mainly because of the fact that it is not american neither european culture you are getting from this one.In fact you can not relate to the characters at all until episode 5-6 for the korean culture is so different from what we europeans and americans probably too (even though americans and their culture are pretty demented so you can never really tell) can relate to.To conclude as I already indicated above the only catchy thing about this title is how different it os from what we are used to "consume". Like a breath of fresh air that you realize after a minute or two is not really that fresh.The raw depiction of brutality is what I believe attracted the people most to this show but really there is nothing more to it.Lastly Id like to add that 4 out 9 episodes (1,2,7 and 9 - it is really a shame that final episode is one of the weakest of the season/show) were boring and really low quality.I scored this one 6/10 and anyone that has seen more than just the most commercial bites from international cinematography can only agree.
9	27 September 2021	yarunas	surprisingly good!	It doesn't appeal at first, but if you you'll stay tuned, you'll see a really good drama series with some very well written characters.Watch it!
6	15 October 2021	reinjakobson	Reminds Snowpiercer with Chris Evans	For some reason it reminds me "Snowpiercer". It's claustrophobic, paranoiac, futuristic, twisted and lethal. Style and costumes are very iconic. You cant forget those pink suits after watching it.
7	8 October 2021	guuspalmer	Cool story till halfway and ridiculous ending	The first two episodes were very promising. Nice balance between violence, humor and craziness. From episode 5 everything goes downhill. The story becomes something softy... People becoming too emotional in the ordinary ways... Also, the last episode was bad, vague dialogues, completely ridiculous choices by the main character and an ending that doesn't make sense at all.To end on a good note, the acting was terrific and the effects and camerawork were excellent!
7	3 October 2021	forster98	Awful VIPs and obvious plot	I liked it overall BUT:The VIPs acted terrible and their script was super cringyIt was kind of obvious that the old man was the creatorThe police side-story didn't really have a purpose. At lesst not for this season.
5	23 September 2021	breaking_it_up	Too predictable and too many plot holes	The story line is way too predictable and there are too many plot holes. 5 stars are for Hoyeon .
8	18 September 2021	zeitgeistsudan2010	Long time for a TV series like this	Perfect acting 👌.. interesting series, with unexpected events.
10	30 September 2021	w_janlendle	Job well done!!	Unexpected movie, brilliant idea,. This is one of the Best movie this year, Jobwell done !!! Netflix should continue to produce a movie like this.. 👍
3	15 October 2021	pjranderson	Am I missing something, this is pretty dull, slow and rather annoying	I was expecting so much from this based on the reviews, media hype and general attention it has been getting. Battle Royale is one of my favourite films so was looking forward to a modern take on that.This has been pretty average throughout, the premise is interesting enough but the games are slow, overreacted whimpering, heavy breathing and an attempt to build suspense. I've watched it dubbed in English and original with subtitles, both are equally underwhelming.Some of the characters just annoy the hell out of me, particularly the woman with the curly hair.It's soooo slow, the games get dragged out to the point you either want to give up or skip forward to get past the filler chat - who cares that tempered glass is 700°?Aesthetically it's very pleasing, the sets are great, the wardrobes give it an edge... this will be the Halloween outfit of the year.All in all it's just about watchable, but the thing I take away is "is that it?".
10	3 October 2021	mjud89	This is a great show!	The series are absolutely interesting, the plot is excellent and the actors are great, too! I really recommend this show to everyone.
9	5 October 2021	Goriz43	Excellent Series - Bad ending	Loved the series, so many good things coming out from Korea lately. Really loved the first six episodes which were fantastic. However last three episodes and as many others have mentioned the VIPs were terrible.I never understood if the cop died, because he was only shot in the shoulder?Also, why wouldn't he use the money in the end hahaha, didn't he have loan sharks after him??I like the fact though that it didn't get a Hollywood ending. All in all, well done Korean television! Keep it up and we can get rid of the shifty Hollywood crappy American stuff once and for all.
9	3 October 2021	amadorl608	Worst betrayal of all time is in this show	Ali get betrayed like no other, rip. That is the moment in the show where I truly realized how evil number 218 was.
10	8 October 2021	deelinsellers	Hunger Games on Steroids	Great show.... Netflix has done it again!Keeps you guessing...
5	10 October 2021	OddViewer	wtf	8.3 today...we are living in a magnificent world... can't understand why people are thinking this show so great...gambling and cruelty...
10	16 October 2021	skrage99	Excellent show will leave you wanting more	Excellent show. When my 13 year old daughter told me she wanted to watch this show as many other kids in her grade were watching it, I thought it was going to be some kind of boring anime. Wooh...not even close. This is an awesome show. I was hooked after the first episode. Yes, there can be some slow parts but it's totally worth it getting through those slow parts because you'll be rewarded later. Just keep watching. My kids were so excited watching it they were yelling out at the tv. If your kids are not used to watching violence on TV then I would not recommend this show to younger viewers; my kids are used to watching scary/weird stuff so it didn't bother them, and they know the blood is fake.Anyway, great show!
1	9 October 2021	abdullah-aj-1	The people around the world talk about it to much and it's not worth it	The worst tv show I ever watched in my life it's totally waste of time.
10	27 September 2021	etd380	Absolutely amazing!!! Mind blowing every step of the way.	I absolutely love it! It reminds me of JIGSAW and ESCAPES ROOM. It make you feel like you are part of the squid game while watching. It will definitely leave you guessing who will survive in the end. I absolutely love HoYeon Jung acting, she's really tough, really cute and beautiful all around. I loved HoYeon Jung character, she kept to herself, strong minded, didn't trust anyone and I love her serious image. She was really amazing! I wish HoYeon Jung could stay for more seasons but unfortunately she died towards the end and I was really upset about it! It was really sad. Keep it coming for more seasons.
7	4 October 2021	ajbettis	Sprint fell short of the finish line	The series was hot to start! Grabbing you and keeping you hooked until episode 3-4 and the true purpose of the game and show started to dwindle. I wish they stuck to the rules and had more games to focus on. Wasnt as intriguing watching them very un-cinematic-like kill each other off. A show that had so much potential fell just short due to poor writing.
10	19 September 2021	markovasiljevic78	WOW	One of the best TV Shows I have ever seen. Simply genious and almost realistic. 6th episode is FABULOUS.I love this TV Show and one of the favourites from 2021.
8	22 September 2021	martin_urk	Excellent series, except the VIP acting	Just binged season, i was hooked after the second episode.After seeing the vip's i went looking for some reviews. Boy... the acting was so out of place. It felt so weird, upon the VIP encounter the acting was really good. It kinda breaks the whole atmosphere.Nevertheless definitly worth watching.
9	19 September 2021	krikites-inc	Quality Drama	Good writing, good acting for most part (except the American actors), good messages, pacing is good.There really isn't much to complain about it once you're immersed into it besides the voices and acting of the American actors.
9	1 October 2021	davidmgrana	Dont mind the critics	I keep seeing people saying that the characters were told that only 1 people could survive. I don't know if they watch a wrongly translated version or what but the version i watch they are told they all can win the prize as long as they finish the 6 games.I also get that the VIPs acting and "intonation" suck, but keep in mind this is a korean show so why would they accurately portrait americans?Show is amazing, main characters acting is superb and music is very good. Just enjoy.
5	10 October 2021	lukejosiahknight	It's basically OK	The games are a nice feature, but it feels very familiar. It's also not that exciting a lot of the time. It's OK. Not sure why there are so many incredible reviews.
7	25 September 2021	vasso-ierem	Very interesting but weak ending	It is the first Korean TV series I watched. I found it very interesting, with fast action. It also gives you food for thought. Unlike series of similar cases, it has the main difference that the players are there voluntarily. This creates different dynamics and plot. Watching the first 6 episodes I was excited. From the 7th episode until the end, there was no surprise and everything was predictable.The explanation of why all this happened,was just what was expected. The story with the policeman and his brother, did not finally seem to have special meaning. The "plot twist" with the old man, was not a plot twist at all, if you have watched "Saw' 1 & 2 and many of the thrillers that followed it. Perfect up to a point, but without a climax. This could have been a 10 but..
10	13 October 2021	jamieliam	A Rare Gem	Firstly no spoilers here.I don't recommend you watch the dub. It's very distracting and can take away the seriousness of the show at times.Its so good. So amazing. Loved it to pieces. Each episode left me wanting more. But then to keep from going through the show too quick I limited myself to two episodes a day.Totally worth it as waiting 24 hours between every 2 episodes really added to the suspense of the show.Highly recommend.
8	26 September 2021	ReviewerAnon	Postdictive Programming	A likely tale based on real life experiences. The elites (VIPs) participate in these types of twisted events. "The Most Dangerous Game" "The Game." Did you notice many of the movie's scenes resembled kill rooms similar to those leaked during Clinton and Podesta's #pizzagate? So ask yourself, why this soft disclosure movie full of kids' games, toys, color, and imagery? What kind of people are REALLY directing "The Game" and who are the INNOCENTS forced to play? This series is once again attempting to disclose the same sickness Kubrick did and was killed for in "Eyes Wide Shut"!
6	11 October 2021	Ash-ElGabry	Solid characters but way too predictable	It started way much better than it ended and by mid-season the series had too many useless long scenes that didn't help the drama...The characters build up was good and most of the main characters has depth but all the events are way way too predictable and in too many instances you waste 5 or more minutes of watching things you already know it will happen with no twists happeningAlso at the first few episodes it had meaningless flashbacks to things happened literally 3 mins before which made feel weak and and shallow...
1	13 October 2021	cutetay7-57-24729	Sadistic and gross	Why are people into this dumb show. Dumb plain dumb. I was intrigued by what would happen by episode 9 I was ready for this nightmare of a show to be over.
9	5 October 2021	kenaigonzalez	Best Show of 2021 🐙	Squid Game is a roller coaster from start to finish! I had no expectations going in and left captivated by the world created - I'm already ready for Season 2.The show is filled with all kinds of twists and turns. The plot is wonderfully planned out with lots of foreshadowing and hints toward the future, but just enough to keep you guessing. I was literally on the edge of my seat for episodes 4, 5, and 6.The masterful use of color paired with the cinematography made it a joy to watch, and the somber music really drew you in.The real big takeaway from this show, though, was the character-driven story. All the actors from the leads to the extras were phenomenal, and I hope to see many members of the ensemble in future projects. Jung Ho-yeon absolutely crushes her first big acting role - keep an eye out for her in the future!A must watch in 2021.
10	20 September 2021	stumpykerr	Bingeworthy	Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! 👍👍👍
1	2 October 2021	mrgsaunders-155-66998	Shocking dubbed by mr bean in his bedroom	I Think dubbing was all done by the same person just putting on silly voices probably is a good series but is a hard watch as the dubbing is shocking makes it a very hard watch.
5	2 October 2021	hopelorinn	Frustrating...	I really think this show could have been great. The plot, the attention to detail... all spot on. The dialogue however, is SO juvenile. It's like sitting around the table with a bunch of middle schoolers. The voice over acting itself is obviously horrid, but the dialogue is what kills it. From what I understand from a previous review from someone who speaks both fluent Korean and English, it was not translated well at all.It's so disappointing that the writers, directors, and actors put so much heart and soul in to this, only for the dialogue to be lazily translated and acted. Shame on Netflix for dropping the ball here.
7	8 October 2021	msnawar	Not a new idea	Binge watched #squid_game today. The idea of the show is not new. It was presented in a movie called 13 in 2010 but it was a Russian Roulette game rather than kids' games. I enjoyed the show but didn't feel it's worth the hype that people have made about it. Anyway if you haven't watched it, please do if you enjoy psychotic movies like American Psycho and The Game.
3	17 October 2021	jon-166-507448	An honest review.	After countless memes and word of mouth suggestions, my girlfriend and I decided to checkout Squid Game. After an episode an a half we decided to stop. It's not the subject matter or the fact that it's an overused story, honestly it just wasn't very good. It was hard to find what all the hype was about. We had a similar experience with Money Heist. Maybe it's the fact that we watched both shows with the English dubbing, I don't know. With squid game however, I just found the acting to be over the top and cheesy. The dubbing just made this so much worse. Example (police officer: "red light green light, you mean that game meant for kids?") TERRIBLY CHEESY writing right there and horrible voice acting. I just can't understand why everyone has been telling me I NEED to watch this show. It was honestly an embarrassing experience, save your time and watch a quality series. 6/10 for filmmaking, 0/10 for writing, acting, and originality. 3/10 total.
10	2 October 2021	eliasbiya8	A must watch Korean series	From the first episode to the last one, this show is top notch. Its a story about life.The struggle that humans go through just to see another day. I watched this show with my girlfriend and we cried a lot together. It was so emotional.I recommend it to everyone who wants to experience greatness. Kudos to the creators and actors.
5	4 October 2021	max_indigo	The violence is not the problem	The violence and gore was fine. It was the over the top excessive smoking that upset me the most.
9	29 September 2021	caitlin_marie	Sooo good	Sooo good but dammit, he should've got on the plane!!
9	19 September 2021	bernielosa	A captivating and gory critique on capitalism	Squid Game takes a oft used trope and keeps it fresh and gripping.
5	7 October 2021	perlonizer	Would have been a cool series maybe, if...	... they didn't try to include a moral story. I really liked the look of the series and all the locations in it. There was a lot of potential to tell a story with an unique vibe. But besides of the fact that most parts of the storyline were predictable (it often felt like the series was produced for people who never watched a series before), it is not very profound or smart of the main character that he agrees to participate in a game to kill other people for money in the first place, and in the following days he notices that it was a cruel thing to do. One year later he even played a game again while risking that a homeless person freezes to death. Looks like he didn't learn a lot.
9	17 October 2021	youssefmourad	"Hunger Games" + "Parasite" = "Squid Game"	About capitalism and other hidden things.Squid Game is an entertaining series that draws the light on modern problems from a unique angle.We all fall into debt, we all have problems that need a miracle to be solved, but what is the cost of a miracle?Great acting, great cinematography, great production design and a really clever scenario that made us on the edge of our seats nine episodes long.Since I started watching Korean art I always have had problems with their way of acting.. Or to be precise with their way of expression..(oh yeong-su) the Korean actor.. Changed that forever.. His truthful way of expression really astonished me. I wanted him to be present in every frame.Im thankful for the director and for Netflix they made this happen.. This will make me - in the future- consider following Korean art regularly.If you watched the show and you came here looking for answers, explanations or analysis.. I advice you not to.. This show is intendedly made for every one of us to understand it on his own.. And to interpret it his way.. Yet I think it has the same effect.. Nothing is more important than a human soul.I'm a Muslim but i recall from the Bible :"For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?"
3	13 October 2021	boxigor	Recycled ideas all over the place	The series is a collection of second-hand ideas, characters and plots collected from all over the place - starting from a Japanese movie 'Shinkansen daibakuha' about desperate workers finishing with a Russian movie 'New Land' about letting prisoners manage themselves. Not to mention dozens of survive-for-money US movies such as recent 'Escape Room'.The only reason this series seems to appeal to Netflix auditorium is because it's Korean, so entourage and decorations look fresh and new.
8	30 September 2021	ryanbitzer-20118	Twisted but Intriguing!	I rarely watch non-American TV shows or movies but the plot of this show just pulled me right in to watch it. Phenomenal acting, great cliffhangers, and very emotional near the end of the season! I REALLY hope the second season starts up soon!
10	21 September 2021	talal-67551	Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars.	Korean tv NEVER disappoints, this show was utterly creative, idea , execution , acting , and whole lotta thrill, it kept me wanting for more, GREAT job!
9	11 October 2021	vasilyaartemov	A very good Korean series	Extra star rating for not giving a **** and including unnecessary blm or lgbt agenda. Great show, really shows what animals some of us really are deep inside.
1	6 October 2021	blny	Terrible	Once I got over the terrible dubbing, and persevered with the conflicting English CC and English Standard subtitles (with both English and Korean audio), I painstakingly dragged myself through all 9 episodes.Some of the worst acting I've seen in a foreign movie, story is ridiculous (and I watch a lot of B movies), overall a really bad attempt at Saw style movie with a terrible ending.Don't watch, not worth the hype.
6	10 October 2021	bishtkrishna	Overrated	Netflix knows how to promote an avg series.only 2 episode were good.
7	2 October 2021	mojavecali	It's great but	So gambling, is bad, I try not to bet much only when I did decide to pick Green Bay for 50 and Chiefs for 50 and get 130 back because Green Bay loss... and I could've gotten another 160. So you see, gambling isn't good😂. Anyways the main theme of this show is in Korea people struggle. And everyone's life's suck ass.The show follows this guy who just won big in Horse racing and gets picked pocketed and loan Sharks come after him and then meets a stalker business man. They play ddakji. This a game where you have to flip the paper on the ground, and the main character loses and in exchanged gets slapped to lose 100,000 wons from the debt count. And so he walks away with 200,000 wons. And so he returns home and his mom is upset because he looks brutally beaten up. Anyways he has the card from the business man and goes to where he'll be picked up and enter the game: Squid game duh duh duh. Also he's number 456. And so he learns they're gonna play the worse twisted Saw like games that are children games basically- Red light/Green Light, Honey comb cutting out the cookie, marbles, tug of war, squid game and hop starch(on glass bridge). The show is so detailed and has so many good ideas that I really over look the cliques, the plot armor and plot conveniences. The twist I have to say I saw coming because it's obvious, as I watch so many movies I saw many things coming. And I love the music score, the best I've heard in a while. The editing so top notch, the violence is not that bad, everyone complaining hasn't watched Saw. This is funny and it's not in bad spirit tbh, like it has meaning. And the acting of you go from English over the Korean actors to subtitles is pretty good. I like how unique this show is even tho I've seen Hunger games and Battle royal and Saw. This is the best out of them, the child games they play is hilarious and I love it all, I didn't see what was coming but I wanted Tag or Red rover or spear the queer lmao. But this show is so heart warming so energized and so horror I like it a lot. I'll give it a B+, the only bad thing is sometimes some of the subplots are nonsense and the cop is annoying, and the VIPs suck ass. But beside that I love this show. Watch it!!!
10	25 September 2021	jason-30766	Masterpiece	I don't usually review, but when I do, It is really really good.
10	18 September 2021	damir-46548	One of the best series in a long time	Acting 10/10Story 10/10.I higly recommend this series.
8	12 October 2021	Dionice	Overrated but okay.	I feel like the show's overrated. There were too many holes in the story IMO. First of all, does the battery on that officer's phone ever run out? Secondly, how do people go missing (and not just one, but more than 400 each time) and nobody finds out anything? And they have been running the games for years now, so, it is pretty unrealistic. In addition, don't people get flagged for having all that money suddenly in their bank accounts? However, the overall idea of show was something new and exciting. It is worth watching, but there are far better shows out there.
9	17 September 2021	rahulalia	WOW JUST WOW!!	Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!
8	26 September 2021	eagle_eyes2	Show Adds Morals and Is Captivating	I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.
9	4 October 2021	jacobssonhugo	All that build-up just for the VIP:s to ruin it	I enjoyed the show a lot but to be honest, if you were to randomly pick some American guys of the street, i think that they would've done a better job acting than the cast for the VIP:s - personally i would have rated Squid Game a 10/10 if it wasn't for them.
6	2 October 2021	silencial	Good but very predictable	Given the hype of this series, I caved and started watching it. I've seen Alice in Borderland before and loved that one. Squid Game feels a little like a bit of copy and mix of different already existing content, they even use the Battle Royal music to announce games :D That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this series, it was good but quite slow and so extremely predictable. Be it that I'm used to watching thrillers and horror movies, but I wasn't really surprised by any of the revelations.I'd be happy if it finishes here, anything else would just be a repetition anyway.Good watch if you're bored. Does it live up to the hype? Definitely not, no idea why it's being so overhyped.
7	9 October 2021	johncvw	Great and somewhat disturbing but you can't stop watching it	I watched all 9 episodes over 3 days. The 8th episode started to be somewhat dull and lacked the excitement of the others. However the 9th and final episode was a complete disaster and almost unwatchable. The 10 minute explanation of the games given by and old man was so painful and extremely boring to watch. There were so so many unanswered questions, very boring and uninspiring dialog and acting, no cliffhanger to make you not really care if there is another series.
1	12 October 2021	adinarayanamoorthychanukya	Not worth the hype	One the worst shows that i've watched in recent times, if possible don't watch, it's a waste of time, the plot character is literally walking down the road in goody shoes.
6	1 October 2021	khageshjain	OVERHYPED !!	This series is literally overhyped. The story was predictable. The acting was decent. The more you watch it, the more it starts to get boring. Started off well but has a huge decline once the series starts progressing.I don't understand why people are praising this series. One can even skip it and not worry about missing a lot.People don't have their own opinion these days. If their friends like something then they gotta praise it as well and that's what happened to this series. Some people started praising it and everyone followed the train.Don't waste your time on this. Better move on and watch something else.
10	24 September 2021	carlyknight	Watched in one day	Loved it. Hooked from the start. Well done! Hope there is a season 2!
10	28 September 2021	susada	Excelent	A mix of Hunger Games, Parasite, Hostel and Saw.It shows how human nature really is.
7	1 October 2021	zoran_nuneski	OVERRATED	The series definitely has its pros and cons. They have an interesting story, but it is not completely credible. I was definitely expecting an explanation for why the game was made and I got it, but it was pretty lukewarm and not convincing. Some of the characters are also quite poorly portrayed and processed. The acting at times seemed artificial to me. The series it is not bad, but it is definitely a overrated.
9	17 October 2021	talamasca-93537	The End...	Great series, this is for me one of must-watch series.I only don't like the end, the last five minutes didn't have to happen, it should end with his entering in the plain and that would be enough.
3	30 September 2021	emillassen-81983	Did we all watch the same show?	The main character cannot act to save his life. I found myself not caring for most of the characters, so the emotional scenes and the supposed suspense during the games fell flat.I was hoping for some inventive games, but that wasn't the concept I suppose.I've watched a lot of terrible netflix shows, but I couldn't even finish this one. I stopped before the VIP episode, which people seems to be very angry about, so I don't count that towards my rating of 3 stars.I honestly don't understand how some people can rate this 9/10. I get 10/10, because some people get excited easily and want to improve the score of a show they like, but 8 or 9/10 seems to suggest that it's one of the better shows of the year, and that those people actually thought about their ratings. I don't get it, man.
10	21 September 2021	asabudeen_jr	The best thing I watched on recent years	My god!! Where do i even start? The whole series was on another level. I don't know how they managed to make every single minute thrilling and entertaining. I was about to watch few episodes now and rest later then ended up watching the whole series on one day and oh boy the subs were horrible i can pretty much understand everything on korean so i watched few episodes without subs cuz of how bad the subs were. Other than that another masterpiece by koreans, loved it from start to end.
3	14 October 2021	wielandmd-05443	Dissapointing	I really don't understand the high ratings and all the media hype. Very shallow , simple and predictable storyline, horrible (over) acting (with the exception of Jung Hoyoen) and too many loose ends. Camera work is average at best and props are a joke. This could well have been a school project for students. From all the fuzz in the media I had expected much more.
6	2 October 2021	austingarcia-71282	Amazing until the end	It's nail biting the entire time and I'm the end you don't get to see who the VIPs are, you don't get to see the one VIP explain what it is, you don't get to see anything the police officer gathered, you don't know how the police officers brother became the front man, he tries to save a man that killed all of his friends in the end, the old guy doesn't ever get to the point in what he's saying to the point where it's frustrating, and he never goes to see his kid with all the money. He did help the girls little brother though that's the only good thing about the end.
8	3 October 2021	cranberrygraves	Decent	It's a well done version of stories and movies we've seen a million times before. Nothing groundbreaking but good for what it is.
8	20 September 2021	marc_potgieter-17528	Well worth watching	Wife and I really enjoyed the series. The storyline and acting was great.The only thing I would fault it on is the foreigners in the show. The Korean actors were top notch and believable.... while the vips just seemed like they found random foreigners in Seoul to play the characters. Even Abi seemed a bit strange at times.
10	3 October 2021	ialhasso	Master pace 🙌	Every thing is perfect on this series.Can not wait for season 2.Koran keep it up.
10	2 October 2021	sakellarimar	I couldn't stop watching till the END!	I loved this show!! I wish I could forget it and just watch it for the first time again! It stays in your mind for a while, the concept was insane and cruel.. The manipulation was the real game! They knew exactly how the instincts of the players will work each time.I felt sorry for like everyone in the finale, but I liked the way he fixed the "family issues" with the little boy and the old lady!
10	14 October 2021	cstujones	Cult classic	Wow! Just WOW! Just when i was losing hope with some of the garbage thats produced these days comes this absolute sky rocket! The squid games is as close to tv show perfection as it gets. Original clever story, great characters, visually stunning and some great twists.Im literally obsessed with how stunning the sets are and how genius but simple the story is.This show will be one of those shows which will be getting repeatedly copied, from things like red light green light to the stunning original costumes of the soldiers and the front man.This literally is and will be an all time classic.
10	6 October 2021	lealmark	Stop watching the walking dead for this!	Just an amazing show well written! Fantastic! Worth every second!
9	28 September 2021	naniab	MORE THAN EXPECTATION!	Just watch it. No hesitation. BINGED WATCHED IT IN ONE GO! I want moreeeee! Didn't know, how this would take me for an emotional/thrilling/suspense / unexpected roller coaster.
10	18 September 2021	emil-39227	A sign from the universe	I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth.
10	7 October 2021	kumaramit-63267	Great!!!	Netflix always grab the bang on shows. This one is at another level.Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10yrs to publish this drama....
10	7 October 2021	kumaramit-63267	Great!!!	Netflix always grabs bang on shows, and this one is another level i watched earlier but shoked yet and thinking about the series....Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10 years to publish this drama....
8	2 October 2021	tremonxd	VIPs acting is GOOD! Proof	As another review says, the VIPs acting is not bad. The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.As for the show, it is a great show. I strongly recommend watching it.Maybe not a 10/10 as that is reserved for films that changed my life, but definitely a 8/10.It is a great metaphor of capitalism and how our society forces people into extreme situations.
8	22 September 2021	devinelq	Good in general but	Just don't count on cops for real, when comes to a situation like this. They get paid monthly and they are hired by the goverment. They don't know you. Count on yourself and your community which is organic. Asians need to grow up and seek for help from anything other than a strong government.
10	30 September 2021	SeanEvans905	Incredible. Just Incredible	One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend watching it if you don't mind watching in Korean. The English dub isn't as good as the Korean version so I recommend you watch with English subtitles. Brilliant acting throughout.
9	11 October 2021	anikulkarni-68344	Get hooked for the ride from episode 1	Looking at name, I wasn't much into it. Trailer was also ok'ish. I just casualy played the first episode and then boom, was hooked. Binge watched later episodes.It has multiple 'oh fxxx' moments. Caste is nice and everybody has given their best in acting department. Cinematography is good too. Ending was unusual and came as a surprise, with a twist. Definitely going to watch season 2, whenever that comes out. I think Netflix will bring multiple seasons of this looking at response it is getting. This hatke drama was good for a change.
5	3 October 2021	briareos11	It has been done before........better!	The concept of some broke people playing games for their lifes has been done in asian media for like 40 years. While this show has one great episode (the one with marbles) and some good scenes, much of it was not thrilling at all. And the ending was kinda silly (the haircut!).The concept has been executed the best with the Anime Kaiji 15 years ago, super thrilling. Would recommend watching this instead.
9	24 September 2021	matthewjleming	Yes, the VIPs sucked, but that didn't ruin the series	Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb.
10	29 September 2021	zakariasnl	Awesome!	Loved every minute, couldn't stop watching!They did a great job in making it feel more "realistic" and not like SAW or some other classic horror/thriller movie.
1	2 October 2021	aysegulsalgur-24900	May cause psychological damage in young people	As a mother, I recommend especially young people to stay away from this series, it is a very harmful series even for an adult with normal psychology, the age group is +18 and the suicidal tendency is increasing in the young people who follow it, if you care about your child, do not allow watch it.
10	16 October 2021	kh-39648	It is not perfect. But It was very entertaining	Everyone talking about it, So I just wanted to try one episode. But I finished just one night. I could not sleep. I think this is best Netflix show ever.
9	26 September 2021	accountingprof	Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae	Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae not my Greg Chun.Kindly edit the cast.
5	1 October 2021	chinonyumax	Boring games and Everyone's a saint?	Ok....i get it the hype its incredible...Theres a lot of time when im watching the drama, i've asked my self what would happened if a Japanese production team was behind all of this...Dont get the wrong idea, the drama's story line itself is fantastic, the characters development between each others is superb..... but...The games they play... its kinda boring isnt?Ok i get it... its based on a Korean childhood tradition games...but if you wanna make it a between life and death situation ish kinda games....games like that...its just boring as hellPersonally, the only time where i genuinely felt fear for the characters is when they're playing the glass platform games and the tug of war...It really shows us they are genuinely fear for their live if they've made a wrong step they will DIE...If the games have a certain skills to win it...well its boring as hell...IF you play a game like paper rock scissors, heads or tails, or the game with a little bit luck includes in the game they're playing... that would be 10times better than cutting a piece of sugar candy...because you'll never know how its gonna turn out...Each of them are considered losers in the real world and they came back for a second time trying to win the money for them self...but no...everyone is being good to one another, well apart for the fat man...Consider they all came back for the second time, they all knew if they keep playing some will die but they all need the money, It only make sense if the characters betray each others trying to win the game for themselves other than just being scammed or getting lied like ONLY in the marbles gamesWhy did i mention about Japanese director instead of a Korean one? Well... this genre has always been my favourite since long time ago and the Japanese really know what they're up to.Go watch an Animie call Kaiji, you'll understands the standard for this particular genre...The betrayal the urge of wanna get out alive... i felt it all when watching the Animie...but in squid game? Well... not so much... almost nothing if im being honest.
7	4 October 2021	hood-86806	Predictable but Enjoyable	We can't deny the fact that this series is pretty much predictable, and the notion that the villain & VIP's were randomly selected, however; I don't regret watching it cz of the thrilling plots and the good developing of characters.
6	2 October 2021	aitchess	Great show but	I really enjoyed the show but there was too much violence it's disturbing.
8	23 September 2021	Mic_sc	My first Korean TV series Wao...	My first Korean TV series I have seen all episodes. Wao I love it like there are violence scenes that go over the border, and good stories of rich and poor, what money do to people in difficult times in life.
10	1 October 2021	izabellafadel	Wow!	Enjoyable show. Wish the translation was more accurate however.
7	7 October 2021	marahlozi	Great start, goes downhill from there...	After all the hype this series caused I finally decided to watch it and honestly I enjoyed the beginning of it up until maybe the 6th episode. The games started to become boring and meaningless and the VIPs were the worst thing ever! Bad acting and awful dialogue, no one talks like that in real life, they had so much potential but it was wasted. The ending was disappointing, okay number 001 was the mastermind but that's it?! Really! And the main guy who won bothered me to no end, he was depressed and losing it over all the lives lost because of this game, blaming the rich for the game when in reality the poor enabled this too, the blame isn't solitary! And he refused to do anything or help anyone with the money for a whole year! He was a loser with no ambition before the squid game and chose to stay that way after it! He could've helped so many people, instead he sat in a corner feeling sorry for himself for a whole year, pathetic! Then when he pulls himself together (red hair and all) he backtracks at the last minute and decides oh I'm gonna undo all my character development and do the stupid impulsive thing instead! What a disappointment truly, again this had so much wasted potential, it could have been something truly mind blowing.
5	30 September 2021	kaliwowjiyeon	Not worth the hype!	Everything is good but the plot, the game and character development. It might seem fresh for non survival or Korean show watchers, but surely it didn't do any sides good whether if it's the survival or the psychological part. Squid Game is a good show for entertaining but not even that close to what people are hyping it as for sure.
8	25 September 2021	ezgisesilc	very good but Were some scenes really necessary?	Squid game was really good, beyond my expactations. However, VIPs part and final was so cheesy! You shound watch behind the scenes video and see that most places, they were real!
9	25 September 2021	firiozifirion	Amazing acting.	Amazing acting by the main actors and side characters. VIPs were the only annoying part of the movie but they did their part. Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the "games". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc.
6	11 October 2021	jhitsugaya	Enjoyable, but overrated and seriously flawed	The show in the beginning was interesting and unpredictable. It gave a glimpse of the desperation the lower class faces to survive in a cruel world. Emotional connections and back stories were established for most of the side characters making some deaths quite emotionally gripping.The biggest issues I have with the show are the twists. Mainly, Il-nam being the host of the show and the front man being the cop's brother. The old man's motivation for making such a gruesome game was because he was rich, bored and didn't see kindness in the world doesn't sit well with a lot of people. It made sense in the first game as he smiles as he walks past people being shot, but his behavior in the rest of the show is incongruent. There are other points to be made on the old man, but now I'll mention the cop's brother being the front man twist. It was shown that the brother was a previous winner of the game, but to leave a massive plot hole as to why he did this is insane. After shooting the cop and being briefly haunted by his decision is all we get from that. I personally found that cheap and lazy to bring shock to the viewers. Also, there is no excuse for the VIP's to have such horrendous acting. They can act all high and mighty, but the delivery was hard to watchDespite the interesting foreshadowing that hinted as to what will happen to the side characters in the future, it can't be helped that it was all marred by inconsistent writing and plot armor. An enjoyable show, but not an 8 by any means.
8	9 October 2021	tylerjonahlorette	Overrated but still very good	INDIRECT SPOILERSThis show was definitely overhyped but there were some incredible moments (basically all of which are the games themselves). The twist at the end is definitely an interesting concept but doesn't really make sense and leaves a lot of massive plot holes. The games themselves are some of the most enjoyable scenes of television I've watched in a while, but outside of them there isn't too much excitement. The show is smart but not clever, it's predictable but not in a boring way but an exciting way for predicting something right, but later it's revealed you were actually not right. Very cool show but the finale is easily the worst episode and the episode before it feels like mostly filler.
10	20 September 2021	yannicmaurer	Great Show!	It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen in my life. Interesting plot, great acting etc.
8	5 October 2021	callumbawden	Well worth a watch..but some advisories..	This is a thoroughly enjoyable and binge worthy series although..The VIP acting is horrendous, really spoils what was great acting up until then.Also, don't bother watching with subtitles. They are so far off you'd be as well guessing what's being said in Korean and you'd still be better off.All said and done though. Great watch regardless and a series not to be missed out on, even if only for the memes on social media...
5	29 September 2021	justinpengahs	VERY GOOD SHOW UNTIL EPISODE 7	I was very much enjoying this show and one of my favourite characters is Sae-byeok. Her scene with Ji-yeong who gave up her marbles for her in episode 6 was by far the most emotional scene for me. Throughout the show, she was portrayed as a cold and emotionless girl, right up until that scene when she finally broke.Even though I loved her character, I already knew she wasn't going to make it till the end. But a character like her deserves an impactful ending and that was all I wanted for her. However, the way she got injured and eventually died was total BS for me.Before you come at me by saying that I'm too emotionally invested, read what I have to say next.In episode 7, the remaining players go through a bridge of glass. They choose between 2 types of glasses to step on: Regular glass and Tempered glass. Many of them made missteps and fell and the glass broke. Towards the end of the episode, we were left with 3. When the game ended, the glass bridge shatters and Sae-byeok gets stabbed with a shard.If you playback at the scene where the glass shatters, you'll see the huge error made where the glass that should have already been shattered by the players were shattered again. This HUGE error caused me to lose all immersion in the show.Furthermore, up till this point, all injuries to players were made by other players. Their policy was that all players should be given equal chance to succeed. So what was the point in shattering the bridge and injuring the players?Episode 7 had some poor decision making in terms of writing and visuals. From then on, it was hard for me to enjoy the last 2 episodes.
1	18 October 2021	lsuplicy	Be wise. Don't even consider this trash.	The last thing people in a world afflicted by so many conflicts is a show that boast nothing but violence to the extreme. I stopped watching after the 1st episode.No content whatsoever. Just disgraceful violence. Watch The Crown. Feel good. This is bad content to the soul. Can't imagine the whole world has become addicted to this brutal unnecessary bloodshed. World's gone crazy.
9	22 September 2021	nhiphuonghuynh	Worth binge-watching!	Your eyes will stick to the series hours by hours. I cried, laughed, and feared at the same time. K-drama is always worth watching!
9	17 September 2021	jaeyeon_jung	Definitely one of the most well-made Netflix shows by Korea	Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget.
5	16 October 2021	katesolovyova	Everyone that I know is raving about Squid Games.	But to tell you the truth, it is so so for me, no intrigue. I did not get the wow effect, no strong desire to watch it again. There is lots of violence and killing, and the methods of some of these murders are kinda brutal. The main purpose of this show what people would really do for money and to show how far people would go.
10	23 September 2021	petrosavgousti	Wow	One of the best series i have ever watched in my life (and i watched a lot!).However that VIP acting was the most rerrible acting i have ever seen in my life. Terrible.On the contrary everything else about the serieswas top notch quality. Acting? 10. Screenplay? 10 Director? 10 Camera angles? 10Game rooms? 10/10.
8	30 September 2021	ashleycook-40861	Great show overall!	I know the idea behind the show is messed up and cruel... But what isn't nowadays? I don't know about y'all, but I genuinely enjoyed the series. The acting is really good with well known actors and actresses. It's a very slow-paced show, which sucks, but overall I truly enjoyed it through and through......until the end. They could've done better. The moral/message behind the ending has a deep meaning, but otherwise, I didn't like the ending all that much.It did seem like they left it open for a second season. Fingers crossed, because I'll be watching! 🤞
2	6 October 2021	darioc-94844	Very trivial...	The series starts quite well, giving me hope, but immediately ends up in a bunch of commonplaces and boring dialogues.There is much better to watch out there..
7	30 September 2021	yordiugent	Sensational but so many production errors	1. Storyline based on "equality within the game which can not be found in the real world", yet there is a bunch of stuff that makes the players start on unequal foot caused by the game itself. One of the candidates getting hit by glass from the blown bridge, many random pre selections and much more hindering factors making it more based on randomness rather than equality. At the end they also stray from this principle which they laid out so abruptly and went for the sensational card where "they're just race horses for the enjoyment of the rich". Just very strange and random.2. Not sure if anyone noticed but during the 5th game with the glass bridge while candidates were on the bridge glass was just randomly repaired again after every candidate, until multiple people were on the bridge then it stayed broken leaving another equality but also just a technical error from the show, near the end aswell while all candidates are on the bridge one of the first glasses which was repaired was broken again after. If you pay attention during the scene of the game you'll see this is just really odd and inconsistent.3. The detective's brother who is the frontman only recently dissapeared, but won ages ago and now has been frontman for multiple games, how does this make sense?4. They started out very interestingly and the principles of the show had potential, but they just dissapeared and changed in the middle of the show. The ending was also just completely random and felt like a waste, only functioned to setup a second season, if they had made it a one season mini series building on the principles they started with, this could've been a banger.5. VIP actors, no words.6. The main roles were great though, so were the actors.7. The last game and fight was very forced and weird, alot of predictability near the end.8. The Jung Ho-yeon & Yooomee Lee dynamic was so good.
10	1 October 2021	minionabir	One of the best series of 2021	Thb, I really liked this series. Full of thrilled. Enjoyed every episode of the season.
10	25 September 2021	iclaudius-72551	Keeps you on edge of seat	Way better than Hunger Games. Great story, actors, and moral choices and animal instincts of humans.
5	12 October 2021	ingohere	overrated series	For me, an overrated series.The idea and the theme are good.The acting is weak.The dialogues are boring and unnecessarily long.Jung Hoyeon was the only actress who convinced me.
1	17 October 2021	zeolujic	Waste of time	Waste of time. Don't watch it. Rather go outside or you can take a nice nap, relax. Anything is better than this. I'm actually sorry that I boosted the show.
9	16 October 2021	diapetrick	The Blue Danube had a whole new meaning	I generally don't watch such violent entertainment but my son recommended this to me & I got hooked. Go figure, huh? Look, it's an interesting story, twists, turns, deceit & treachery all the way. But it's gory & at times perverse. Enjoy?
7	15 October 2021	gs-27537	Great plot but acting...	The concept and plot is good, I'm not saying it's rare and not hv seen in any movie/series before but the masks, games, game rules, ect are well written.But when it comes to acting, you'll notice sometime chachters are behaving too unnatural, maybe i felt it bcz of i watched it in English (Original language is Korian) i also tried in Hindi but it was far worse.I was going to give it 6 stars, but last episode was good so 7 star for dat.
9	13 October 2021	wsshrimper-05531	Eye Watering	This is what Takeshi's Castle would have been if Sam Peckinpah or Quentin Tarantino had been in charge. An entertaining concept, with loads of bloodshed. What else do you need?
10	19 September 2021	shadhirm	Wonderful and loved every bit of it!	One of the best Korean series I have watched and loved every aspect of the show!. All the actors did exceptionally well. Eagerly waiting for another Season!
10	28 September 2021	thedkin	Great and i have suggestion to make	We didn't need to see foreign vip actors that wasn't necessary.
10	23 September 2021	eblee-29603	Great Show!	One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2.
1	10 October 2021	rukhsaargulzar-49450	My eyes hurt	Honestly, I did not find the point of anything. The games made no sense, killing the people made no sense, the motive behind the games made no sense and the cherry on the cake were the VIPs! 😂 Absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a dystopian society then the first hunger hames and the first book maze runner are pretty decent comparatively. But this did not work for me. I need to watch something really nice to chance my mood.
7	3 October 2021	suhaibalnaji	VIP hate	Every one hating on the vip's i mean the did a pretty job their cringe humor is a type u. Will see among rich the bad lines mad them more interesting.
7	29 September 2021	degonyte	An entertaining and addictive series with an occasionally shallow plot	Squid Game is absolutely worth the watch. It is fascinating, exciting and at times moving. The first and currently only season is highly suited for a proper binging session, as the conclusion of each episode will leave you wondering what will happen next, and where all of this will ultimately go. Sadly, the pay-off is not as grand as we are led to believe.The visual presentation of Squid Game is wonderfully surreal. Endless staircases, pastel colors and trick doors make the entrance to the game area seem like a demented funhouse designed by M. C. Escher. The facility is guarded by ominous masked figures in bright pink jumpsuits, and the game areas themselves are nightmarish visions of children's playgrounds. This gives the entire series an uncanny, oppressive atmosphere throughout all nine episodes. In terms of set design, costume design and overall visual presentation, Squid Game could not have done much better.However, the narrative that unfolds against this otherworldly backdrop is not always as coherent or fleshed-out as the perfectly composed environments would suggest.Squid Game is a variation of the concept of a 'death game', which has been seen many times before in productions such as Running Man and Hunger Games.Series director and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk adds variation to this familiar concept by emphasizing the voluntary nature of the game: each contestant has to apply themselves in order to join the game, and even after they have been sedated and kidnapped to the island where the games are to take place, they are given ample opportunity to leave and return to their normal lives.The game rules even include the option to halt the games at any time, should a majority of the contestants vote to do so. In episode 2, this is exactly what ends up happening. The episode then goes on to try and establish that, despite the horrors of these murderous children's games, the normal lives of the participants are so dire and hopeless that they cannot but conclude that game is the lesser of two evils, and by the end of the episode, 93% of the original surviving players have returned to continue the game. This is an impossible idea to sell to an audience, even when the pool of contestants is supposed to consist of the country's most desperate and indebted.Fantastical premise aside, the way the actual games play out will leave you with sweaty palms more than once. In addition to its presentation, another strong point of the series is feeding us information and letting us try and puzzle it together before feeding us answers. The behavior and motivation of certain characters and even major plot points can be figured out well in advance if you know what to look for and how to piece it all together. This adds an extra layer of tension to the already nerve-wrecking death games.Although the series eventually goes out of its way to answer some of the most pressing questions, there is occasional room for speculation. Was Sang Woo a humble man who got corrupted by his desperation to win the game, only to find back his humanity at the very end? Or was he a cold and calculating cutthroat who was planning to abuse the trust of others from the get-go, ultimately taking his own life simply because he refused to go back to his miserable life?Squid Game could have benefitted from leaving more of such questions open to the interpretation of the viewer. The most glaring example of this is the mystery surrounding the VIPs who view and fund these games, which was decisively shattered by the absolutely horrid actors who played them, clumsily delivering dialogue so juvenile that you couldn't get away with it in a Call of Duty voice lobby.Similarly, the big reveal at the end, that the old man was the mastermind behind it all, might have been best left to fan speculation. Not only does this Scooby Doo-like villain reveal feel cheap, predictable and too on-the-nose, but when the character is asked about his motivation for the game, the answer reveals how downright shallow the plot can be on occasions. The old man, who is on his deathbed, reveals that the game was put together to provide excitement to himself and his exorbitantly rich friends. Perverted elites paying to see poor, desperate people die for their own twisted entertainment was my first guess upon learning the show's premise, and it was truly disappointing to see that my surface-level observation proved to be all there was to it.That all being said, most of the acting, pacing and visualization of Squid Game do carry the series to great heights. When it's good, it really is good. Particular praise has to go to HoYeon Jung. In what is reportedly her major acting debut, she excellently portrays Kang Sae-byeok, who is perhaps one of the only truly likeable characters playing the game, as she is one of the few contestants not stupid, a backstabber or both. The North Korean defector, who hopes to win the money to help her mother, who still lives in her home country, and her orphaned brother. Sae-byeok wears her cold, almost ruthless disposition as her armor, but ultimately shows more humanity than most of the other contestants, even breaking down completely when her opponent in the marble game throws the match to guarantee Sae-byeok's survival. These shifts in her personality, both sudden and gradual, are given immense weight by the actress's performance, and it's in moments like these that the series truly shines.There can be little doubt that Squid Game is an entertaining, addictive watch. Ultimately though, its inconsistency does end up harming it. The series might hit a home run in one area, but then completely drop the ball in the next. As a viewer, you are left wondering where it all goes, trusting that all these plot points which the creators dangle in front of you will ultimately pay off. In the end, the series is like the giant piggy bank full of money that perpetually hovers over the contestants' heads in the sleeping area. After the violence is over and the dust settles, you get what you expected, but you're still left with a feeling of emptiness.
2	11 October 2021	sebhkcikz	Overrated	Good idea, but poor, shallow acting and very annoying characters. The police man was an exception, though. Lots of talking and little action. Easy to guess some of the «surprising» turns in the plot.
10	2 October 2021	patsimmel	Awesome!	I never made a review before but this series is totally worth a review. I really like how it handles to make such great tension in every single episode! Totally worth-to-watch series!
9	4 October 2021	rajeshbkum	Very Good Entertaining series	Worthy to watch, suspense and thriller is peak. I have watched all episodes in a day without sleeping 😴 and make sure that you all get excitement.
5	13 October 2021	mn_hamad	Extremely overrated	Lead character not consistent, very naive and immature script and dialogue. I really don't know why it's a hit. I assume teens around the world are loving it from some odd reasons. Not watching season 2 for sure.
10	25 September 2021	leontiosp	Just fantastic!	This is my first time writing a review on Imdb and i am only doing this because of this series.I have to say that it's one of the best series Netflix has brought to us so far. If i ever had the ability to forget everything and rewatch it, i would have done it.A really exciting and dramatic series at the same time. It almost made me cry at some point.
10	30 September 2021	chhatbarsanket	It's really a good show 😊😊	Anyone who is bored of his/her life then please watch this show . If you are not happy with your life style then watch the life of the people who have lost everything in life and that's the same thing showed in this show and acting is so real . I just loved this show.
7	30 September 2021	samojloskaemi	Conflicted	On the one hand, the first three episodes of this show amazed me and had me holding my breath. Excellent execution with developing all the characters and creating their backgrounds and motivations, overall plot is intense and interesting, has something to say. The show posed a lot of questions, a lot of mysteries, sadly the answers are why 3 stars got knocked out of my score. More specifically the lack of. The main questions that SHOULD be answered do get answered, but the many many subplots remain unsolved. For example the whole police character and doctor storyline, completely half-assed finish, unsatisfying. Also many many continuity issues. The whole everyone here is equal rule gets broken on the side of its creator every single episode, and there also a lot of shot-to-shot continuity issues which the editor didn't seem to catch, but they are noticeable (like the knife in ep8, a main factor and a huge story element whichh we're ment to keep the focus on but somehow it manages to do a cartwheel in Seong's pocket while being in the CENTER FRAME). The show IS great and definitely deserves a watch, I do still think however that they needed to map out the ending storylines slightly better for tall the secondary characters. I'm not going to waste time talking about the VIPs. Yes they suck and shouldn't be in the show, served almosy no purpose. I wish they were more influtual and coused a rift between the creators because they broke the eqality rule or something. They remain badly executed and any point to them was rendered unexistsant due to their unfinished storyline. Now they're just there to annoy watchers.
6	10 October 2021	ftglamazon	Just fine	Am I mad that I watched it? Nah. Would I recommend to a friend? Also nah. I don't get the hype.
8	3 October 2021	tanzhiliang	-2 stars for the VIPs	Please remove all traces of the VIPs and you can get the 2 stars back.
8	10 October 2021	benbrownoufc	Not perfect but still great	Far from perfect but still great. Watch with subtitles the English dubbing is very poor.
10	20 September 2021	alvingwp	Do not hesitate, just watch it!	Better cast, script and plot than Borderland!Only downside- edge of the seat and non stop binging effect.
1	13 October 2021	woodc-61929	Most Over hyped series ever?	Didn't think much of it, don't understand how it's even trending still and if that has a shop based on the show. Baffles me the most peoplefight over this in Paris lol.
8	3 October 2021	hib-93489	Genius	Very good script and an original idea 💡Acting was goodI didn't like the VIP persons and The ending a little bitit doesn't need more seasons.
10	25 September 2021	k_ocampo	Best show	Best show! The story is excruciating and the best one so far on my suspense k drama list. A must watch drama.
1	7 October 2021	stefanloki	Terrible ending	THIS is BY FAR the WORST ENDING I ever saw in my entire life,and trust me I watched a lot of movies and tv shows.... If you stop watching after episode 6 it is great show but after that it goes from bad to worse.
3	6 October 2021	ajl-33632	Don't believe the hype!	It's visually appealing, and I can get past the bad acting, but the broken storylines are enough to ruin it for me. Wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend.
9	28 September 2021	ntkbiiii	9/10 my first review	I'm in the type of person that can normally get everything that's about to happen in a movie and or shop well they were parts of this where I was shocked maybe last second I would get it but anyways it was incredible regardless of how bad the VIPs act this is one of the best shows I've ever seen in my entire life absolutely incredible.
9	4 October 2021	abanoubgerges-52814	A fantastic series	A series that combines artistic creativity, visual creativity, and genius in the acting performances of the heroes of the work, which rises to be the best series I have watched produced by Netflix, despite the dark side of the story. I also can not forget the creativity in choosing classical music and slow songs that calm the soul in sharp and violent scenes, which gives a wonderful taste in that mixture.
9	8 October 2021	ramaalkhadra	Finally good show	Definitely one of the best series i ever Seen, Specially Netflix original, i was very Tense Through all the episodes, this shows can keep up, The directing is excellent, the pictures amazing, Great story, this was my first Korean series, i was suppose that i can feel so close to every story, even my Culture is so far, in the end i guess the human pain and suffering are the same all over the world,
1	24 September 2021	Twitwo194	Trash Series. Predictable, boring, bad acting	Guys.How can this show even be hyped ?It's easily in my top 5 of the worst series I've ever watched. I'm totally not kidding. I wasted 9 hours of my life for this trash, just to understand why people like it. And I don't get it. It's bad. It's more than bad. It's boring, it's predictable.And I'm not even talking yet about the absolute ridiculous acting.100% trash - at least for people with a little claim in good series. Trust me...
1	14 October 2021	sankalp-90462	Kaiji Ultimate Survivor	Such a blatant rip off. Just watch the anime or read the manga, u will get it. The plot, the MC all remain the same. They just tweeked the events a bit to call it "squid game" and not "kaiji ultimate warrior: live action adaptation". Netflix has launched many anime adaptation, but all of them have failed every single time - Erased, Bleach, Death Note(why??), because in each of them they changed the story, skipped events and trashed the anime. Now they have done the same thing by just changing the name of the adaptation. Hats off to the brilliant plagiarisers of Netflix, may your dumb and clueless customers yield you tons of profit.
9	1 October 2021	fgcvjkr	almost 10/10	This is definitely one of the best series I've watched and you got to give cred to the korean actors, but I'm sorry the V. I. P actors... even though the try their best the whole feeling dies a bit on that episode, as well as at the beginning when the kids play squidgame the shirt gets ripped and in the next scene it's fully normal that felt kinda off, but that detail could have been a missunderstanding by me.
5	20 September 2021	danieljamiri	Plot-Driven, Action-Packed. Ultimately Shallow	This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence.
10	3 October 2021	krysyx	Korean tv shows are amazing...	This is one of the best show i've ever seen in my entire life.And the best show of the year for sure, and by far, i can't wait for season 2.You can go and watch it eyes closed !
1	8 October 2021	ymoeini	Overrate	I do not know why people like this series, of course, there are different tastes. But in my opinion, this series is not worth watching for various reasons: repetitive theme - very weak actors - slow process - nonsense dialogues and ...
10	9 October 2021	joshhendricks-86181	My Reaction.	Premise of the story was common: a man in debt in need of a way out. However, the way he was given a lifeline was innovative and different. Beautiful series apart from the VIPs and the cast was soo good.
9	5 October 2021	jankaskorecova	Highly Recommended	Really great series. Different, although it reminds me a "3%" it is still different enough. I watched it quite fast, good actors. The only negative is the end - last part, not sure if it was as good as expected till then... it was like.. they just really want to prepare for 2.series :/ it was still surprising but not satisfying. Worth of watching !
10	21 September 2021	shrouqmakki	BEST KDRAMA OF 2021	TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.
10	19 September 2021	prkzipp	so so good!	This was one of the best kdramas i've watched on netflix! The storyline, the actors, the acting, it was wonderful. I've never rushed to finish a series before like i did with this one!
10	7 October 2021	mariamhamdi-71910	A super great exciting series 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻	I could see in this series alot of meanings of humanity...And also it shows the everyday struggle for every human being who has nothing but debitsAnd how rich people treats themThis people can do anything just for having fun but in the end karma wins..this series shows how monster we are.
9	1 October 2021	rohan-27266	Wow	Engaging. Thrilling. Absolutely fantastic. A must must watch.
6	21 September 2021	selinyucell	Confused about the show..	First it looked very exciting and fresh content for netflix shows, the first game was amazing but then the following games were quite boring except game 4. The stories about characters were SO BORING, i could not watch most of the storylines about them. The lines were too long and boring and unrelated as well. Police thing was very exciting but then what? He killed by his brother who is the manager of the games(!) and nothing clarified?? Who is he? Why is he the manager of the games? As a watcher, it did not give me the answers so it was a wasted storyline too. And i do not even wanna talk about VIPs and their lines...they were horrible. And the ending, why did you go back? What about your beloved daughter?what about your promises?Besides all of these bad comments, it was a unique show and some scenes were very exciting than i could not even blink. So if you wanna have some disturbingly beautiful and at the same time some boringness you can watch it :)
2	12 October 2021	lolo-91178	Overrated	I saw many stories like this .. no new thingsThere is no special character.
9	21 September 2021	hanks-47863	Bloody excellent	The TV show has an excellent thrilling and engaging premise. Blood and violence are spilt all over the show. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. If you are into "bloody games" show, you will certainly like it.
7	29 September 2021	aragadani	Pretty solid storyline	I think I am not the one who didn't like the cringiests characters in netflix called the "VIPS" and that ruins so bad the tv show, also the end isn't satisfactory as it could be imo.
4	30 September 2021	drayabadr	Stupid ending ruined the show and my weekend	Could have been 7 ep showStupid endingToo much gore.
10	9 October 2021	parminderkhattra-76859	Must watch movie	It is real lesson for ruch and porr people.movie is best every human being must watch this movie once in a life.
2	30 September 2021	inass-ba	This series is not original. VIPs acting horrible	You can say what you want, but this Netflix series is not original. It's copied from a Japanese show Alice in borderland and the American movie series The hunger games. Acting was great until, I saw the vip's, I cringed so hard.
1	2 October 2021	erfandj	bad	Very bad. This film for child 9 olds.dont watch this series .waste time.
9	18 September 2021	siwonest-48234	WOW! Get Me Hooked	It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout.I love battle royal concept and this is one of the best in this concept.Acting was so good and cameos were amazing.I recommended for you to watch it.
4	22 September 2021	hij-42438	farfetched story...	I applaud you for the work that went into a lot of balls and for trying a drama that is rare in Korea as a Korean. But on the other hand, there were a lot of cliché scenes that I felt like I had seen somewhere, and there were a lot of parts that I didn't understand why the story continued and dragged like that. It was not a series of plausible and shocking reversals, but a series of plausible deaths and deterrence. The script is disappointing.
9	30 September 2021	pjreview	not great but good	FOR those who are confused whether to watch the show or not:1. First of all the the vip acting or their role in the show does not matter that much so do not stop yourself from watching due to them2. The show is not disturbing(2-3 scenes you may find it disturbing)3.the background music is goodoverall the show is cool, it is sort of like escape room only there is no escaping so if you like such type then you should definitely give it a shot.
10	26 September 2021	haremgardi	Best	Znnznznznznnsnsnsnsnsnnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnnsnznsnsnznsmz.
5	10 October 2021	ralfkdean-46823	8.3???? Lot of people with serious judgment issues	I couldn't wait to get to episode 8 and stop watching this. I'm a massive fan of S. Korean movies but this was a damp squid (geddit?). Lamely predictable with no tension just excuses to kill people. As if the police intruder would have had the freedom to go and do what he liked. If there's a series 2 (unlikely) I'm not watching. If this is 8.3 then Oldboy is the other side of 20. Very disappointing.
10	11 October 2021	serenahyde	Need a season 2	One of the greatest series this year, hoping for a season 2. Worth the watch >X<
9	6 October 2021	mmvsuriyaprakash	Excellent making and thrilling	All 9episoded are worth watching this is the one of the series that gives the impact of guilt, sadness, sorrow, love and all humans emotions. It has a very grip screenplay. I loved the background score and it elevates the scene and emotions to the next level.
10	4 October 2021	cavefe-17658	awesome series	One of the best webseries with catchy episodes... each episode will amaze you untill the last one.
9	2 October 2021	jeanmessadie	Great Series	Excellent Korean TV Series and what a great performance from the actors and actresses! The VIPs weren't that good, but it didn't effect how much I enjoyed the series.Very well made with lots of nail biting moments. I can't wait to see the next season!
8	2 October 2021	laheyanthony	Push through the first episode	I nearly switched it off during the first episode but I'm really glad I kept with it. Well worth it (except for the VIP's atrocious acting, as most others have said).
10	18 October 2021	jontheman-25261	Best TV show	This is the bad ass show and is the best tv show i have ever seen i did not really like Ep 3 but everything else ws perfect you show 100% watch this show is a full of fun and showed be watched by everyone.
1	26 September 2021	gautammehta-40550	10 thumbs down	Behad bakwas..kaun de raha 8.5 isko?Such a dumb & predictable story & such a drag.Too much filmy nonsense & it drags n drags n drags. Such likeable actors but such a dumb story that you don't even want to knw how it ends & actually you won't miss much coz ending sucks too. Bhai kya bawaseer tha ye..isse achha toh tara Mehta dekh lo.
9	27 September 2021	csekulinstmargaret	067 can step on me	The VIP's were awful omg, and I actually sobbed when Ali and the other girl died in the 4th game. 067 is a goddess who we all should aspire to be like. Can we please force 456 to dye his hair back 😟
9	21 September 2021	sirikbharat	Story and all things are good but The concept if a new one in the web series world	Good The thing is they are stretching It out. Story and all things are good but The concept if a new one in the web series world.
8	5 October 2021	vashisthtanish	Anime==squid game	Squid games us tge alternate version of anime kaiji the ultimate survivor....is awkward how peps steal a work of anime artist and produce it as a mind blowing web series.... although squid game perform well and they complete one thing that's lacking in anime is gud face expression and they done a great job in direction and if u like squid watch kaiji too ... same experience...
3	16 October 2021	ontheroof-30164	So Much Potential	On episode two and the only reason I will watch more is in hopes that it will get better. I do see alot of potential and hope that the games are what brings it together.
9	28 September 2021	mikaylagchen	Squid Sequela	Binge watching till the end of the nine episodes!Anxiety, horror, anger, fear, compassion...with all the mixed feelings. Korean series are always good at capturing the humanity in people and the depression of the society. Hopefully there's Season2 coming! TBC...
6	9 October 2021	artlesshand-32572	It's a okay show, doesn't keep up with the hype tho	ProsInteresting plotFantasstic visualsGreat musicCinematographyConsPredictable after two episodesMediocre acting (awful VIPs and lead)Villains were not developed enoughInconsistencies in the storyConclusionIt's an entertaining and visually appealing drama for sure, but goes downhill after a few episodes. Kinda reminds me of the original "Purge" movie.
9	2 October 2021	srithansama	Captivating yet unsatisfactory	Squid Game has one of the most incredible and unimaginable plots I have ever seen, it starts off with introducing the main character and his primary conflicts in life and how later on he is introduced to the game where he meets several other players to win the cash prize of a 46.5 billion. I wouldn't particularly call this show a masterpiece but it is quite near the mark, it truly depicts of how far humans go can to the deepest extent for their personal gain, the acting is outstanding and exceptional, it is so exquisite that you can feel the character's emotion running through your mind. Each episode just increases your curiosity more and more, that's what makes it extremely interesting, all together it was a meaningful series , the series started of exceptionally good however the ending is something which isn't satisfying at least in my opinion, you can watch and find out for yourself. Although I don't prefer watching Korean content , this is surely one of the reasons I would love to explore more Korean content.
10	6 October 2021	prousejulia	Just brilliant	A modern day battle Royale. A treat for the eyes.....,. ....... .......
10	9 October 2021	bholiansari	Best Series	One of the best series on Netflix. The series is thrilling, emotional, exciting and addictive.
10	7 October 2021	chanakyachandu	I'm very short handed to describe it	Surely a director show we can see it's presented exactly the way he wanted never tried impress anywhere just that raw like natural way I liked very much, it hits differently I you watch it next time after knowing the final episode, definitely in my top favs.
10	1 October 2021	prachimurchhana	Pretty amazing	It's a pretty good drama.it's not like most kdrama very different for a k drama the plot is great you should watch it it's pretty good.
9	1 October 2021	amydonohue-22296	Roller coaster of emotions	I think the actors made this fantastic, some of the best character development I've ever seen. I was so invested I felt torn in some scenes! I agree with another comment about it making you uncomfortable but it was done really well! I really really hope there is a second series! Congratulations for all involved! I also applaud using a predominantly Korean cast as this gives people in the film industry there a time to shine!
7	11 October 2021	sidharthbhatia-81781	Overall pretty good but fades away in the end with a few loopholes	Loved the story overall but some important parts did not make any sense.
10	4 October 2021	xasdbjq	Great film	One of the best serials i've ever seen!!😍Watch it with no doubt.
9	19 September 2021	jaehochoi	Best Korean Netflix drama after Kingdom	This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline.
6	2 October 2021	tiantianmk	Put too much MSG in a dish	This series is so similar to Alice in Boarderland, except only that the crew added flamboyant sets and symbols to make it pretentious. At first I was at least amazed by the idea "game of killing in another world", but after comparing it to Alice, which was shot before Squid Game, I can not give it any kudos. Squid Game speeded up the whole scenario to be eye-catching, but that left the characters shallow and predictable. And the story used too much technique. For example, they didn't elaborate on the deep emotions between players (like the couple), in which case they would make irrational decisions. They only depicted the connection of some new friends, who would not have the strong emotion as close ones. Focusing on the dark side looks cool, but that's not gonna make it a classic. It's like a dish with too much MSG.
5	24 September 2021	njofrica	Few pitfalls made it irritating	Beginning was amazing. However, the sanctimony and dreariness of the main character made it increasingly more difficult to watch. Kang Sae-byeok, for example, would've made a far superior main character. Then, VIPs we're utterly disappointing. What was even the point of Jun Ho, other than being a filler?! Also, this secret organization kidnaps and murders 456 Koreans annually in a very short and specific period of time, yet no one ever notices? Altogether, the concept has potential, but the obvious threads to Saw franchise and insufferable main character just didn't do it for me.
9	26 September 2021	lcco-13895	Gripping and consistently engaging	I see a lot of shows like this that start with a good idea but often fizzle out by resorting to common dystopian clichés like forgettable actors and leads, predictable plot lines and character choices, and the like.I was pleasantly surprised by Squid Game! It engages lots of different subplots in addition to the main game, and manages to make each one very invested and entertaining. If you're someone who wants some fresh takes on the thriller/dystopian scene, pick this show! It'll keep you gripping your seat, theorizing with your friends about who will live and who will die, in and out of the game itself. I had so much fun with this show and recommend it to any group of morbidly curious friends.
2	4 October 2021	vincenttoni-00419	Boring	Nothing new I am seeing in this story. And it's really boring as for me.
9	18 September 2021	frjjvbdr	Great show but wow the acting gets bad in episode 7	Really good show, until the VIPs show up in episode 7. Worst acting I've ever seen. It's like the director doesn't understand English himself and hired random American guys off the street. It doesn't ruin the show, but it's so bad. In general though this is definitely worth a watch.
7	13 October 2021	hanswinfried	Viral	I feel like this is one of those shows that went viral and it's not entirely clear why. The show is good, but nothing so exceptional that it deserves this kind of attention. In my opinion the actors, sound and cinematography are all great and I enjoyed their delivery.The writing on the other hand, is a pretty mixed bag. For example, the show's only subplot (that gets may 20-30% of screentime) has no impact on the main plot and then later resolves itself with a really underwhelming twist. Why did they even bother including it? In general, there are too many senseless twists towards the end that lessen the characters and series.Then there's the rather cliché "rich people pitting poor people against each other" setting. They make the rich villains so cartoonishly evil, that I can't take them seriously. Especially their "69" jokes sound like they were written by a 12-year old on 9GAG.My gripes with the writing aside, I think it was still an interesting watch. There are also some really obvious hints that the show is looking to make a sequel, so maybe the creators can write something more nuanced then.
10	6 October 2021	elahefazelm	Perfect	This movie is fantastic. A new topic that is best addressed.

9	5 October 2021	enehchukwuemeka-35677	Wow..worthy	One of the best series of 2021 i must say.Too Unpredictable....was fun to watch.

10	1 October 2021	lisianesantosbr	squid game is very amazing!!	Korean cinema has been surprising a lot and squid game brought a very well constructed plot following a line of facts that interconnect very well with each other, I loved the way the suspense left nothing to be desired and has an amazing plot. Great!
10	24 September 2021	abdellahelhamzaoui	Squid game	I totally love it so i will give it 10/10. A s a matter of fact all actors were incredible in their acting but the vib were not.
1	8 October 2021	Sky-	This show is trash.	Here is why:1- bad casting.2- cringe acting.3- waste of time.4- plot is so freaking obvious.Overall it is overrated and boring to watch almost made me break my screen of how awful the main character is + the rest of the crew are as bad as him.
9	17 September 2021	gomugomunoad	A great thriller series	It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch. It's definitely reccomended for those who love thriller. Plotwise, I would say it's decent enough to keep u watching and drive the story forward.
10	25 September 2021	jamalhamza-85073	Amazing!	My first K Series ever and I was not disappointed. The story and acting were both amazing.
10	25 September 2021	bercikeimsike	Literally mind blowing show!	I would never thought that a show could blow my mind that much its really deep and also very dark i recommend it for everyone with a strong mind. One of the best shows ever.
8	10 October 2021	hrishiaayem	Starts good, ends Horribly	I would recommend you guys to watch the series although there are some problems.The first six episodes were really good and I was also amazed by the series, but starting from the 7 episode the series goes downhill too deep.Although some might feel it's a cliffhanger ending its really not the old man being the host was kind of predictable and totally did not shock me.And about the guy not entering the plane doesn't make sense to me at all.
9	9 October 2021	olgaanderson-82376	I am now depressed	Too depressing, im gonna go cry now. I'm glad people like it tho.
9	10 October 2021	tashpriya	All episodes was best till the last one	Good one. Enjoyed the episodes a lot. Worth watching. Koreans series or movies always amuse us.
8	7 October 2021	hassanlovekrarx	Ok nice one Netflix	But the end looks so weird and bad and if there's a season 2 most characters gone and it was a bad idea to get out the chains girl I felt so bad for her 💔
2	14 October 2021	leon-43767	Ridiculous - Im worried about humanity	This show is absolutely dreadful, it took me three attempts to get into and gave it on final shot as people were talking about on radio and tv etc. I haven't been this dissapointed since companies add 'Other' to the gender field on applications or sign ups...The show is dull and predictable. Im baffled with what people enjoy about it...even the concept isnt anything new there a at least a dozen game/death films on the market. Based on the reviews I genuinally believe the public are losing the plot and social media is Clearly numbing the brains of most people.
10	3 October 2021	loodapad	Story & Choreography	So unique story i love this movie so much i never seen series like this . This a awesome series ever seen omg.
9	22 September 2021	danielachavez-47411	Masterpiece // VIP's are irrelevant	I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3Something that really made me "cringe" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good.
10	23 September 2021	moonsun-02861	20/10	One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Acting was pretty good and the story and plot were crazy.
10	27 September 2021	cupcakes-89238	AMAZING SHOW! BINGEWORTHY	The first half of the first episode might be a little boring vut the rest of the show is perfect. I couldn't stop watching till the very last minute. It's a MUST watch.
6	12 October 2021	nicgrant-87616	A bit overrated	Not bad, but it's being a bit too over hyped. Seen better, seen worse.
6	16 October 2021	suqddd	Has its great moments.	Short and to the point: Slow start. I didn't feel invested in the main characters' backstory at all. The survival games are pretty entertaining. Although there's way too much unnecessary gore for my liking. The show does generally a great job at portraying the conflict between survival instinct and preserving one's humanity. Last two episodes felt very predictable, cheesy and extremely cliche. Definitely an overrated show, although one worth watching.Ending notes: watch in original Korean dub with subtitles. The English dub is horrendous - the english voice actors fail to convey emotions in their voices.
10	27 September 2021	blacktulipquilts	Fantastic show	Really interesting and different. Definitely binge worthy.Characters were well played and acted. Managed to keep tension throughout.I felt that the addition of the VIPs didn't lend anything to the story line, however I am hoping in series 2 that this will be explored more.
10	12 October 2021	deyalr	Such a Mind Blowing Series...	Waiting for season 2.....what am saying ..its a marvellous series,.
2	9 October 2021	pendragonartoria	Plagiasm	Boringgg. The story adapted by manga actually that comes from Japan, all of you just follow the hype...NxnxndndDjxjdjjddJxnxnx.
5	3 October 2021	aymanbenfehri	great concept but really bad acting and the vip sucked	Bad acting and vip sucked, i wished this concept was made in usa.
9	23 September 2021	morrisseauj	Fantastic	Got sucked in immediately by all of it. Was blown away by the performances too. Each actor does an incredible job. I too was derailed by the VIP characters' dialogue.
9	27 September 2021	nathanbarrettk	Shocked	Had no idea what I was going in to, came out of some episodes with tears in my eyes.
10	4 October 2021	farhanakhatun-39204	Brilliant	Keeps you hooked right up till the end, brilliant, with amazing twists!
9	28 September 2021	joeldowell-11847	Disturbing, Intriguing, and Entertaining	Squid Game is one of the most interesting and gripping shows I've watched in a while. It grabbed my attention and kept it, and while that doesn't take a lot to do, this one made me come back again and again. It's creative, the atmosphere it creates is truly unique, and it shows a horrific perversion of the human mind, both in the VIPs and the Front Man himself.The VIPs were okay. I thought the character design and writing was spot on for what they wanted to portray, but the actors were definitely sub-par. Seems like everybody has said this already though, so I don't need to say much about it.Definitely a 9/10 for me. I'll come back and rewatch it when season 2 (hopefully) airs.
10	2 October 2021	lorilla-91711	Great show	Great show, the VIP's are suck, speaks like they were reciting poem and over acting.
4	3 October 2021	taylorcenci	Like a try-to-be-edgy student film with a Netflix budget.	Unbelievable story and character behaviours. Characters impossible to care about or have interest in. Awful over-acting. Genuinely embarrassing CGI at one point. Too much stuff that's obviously there just 'to be cool' to get clicks. (Put people in suits with masks and people will automatically rate it higher)Reminds me of one of those stupid movies like Cube (1997) you watch just because it's stupid, but this feels like it's trying to be serious and make some type of social commentaries like Parasite (2019) - but is just cringey in its effort.Hints of the Hunger Games, but you can get lost in that fantasy world, this you can't because it's set in the today world.
10	9 October 2021	aakilk-81186	Hearttouching,emotional, twisted and tooooooooo good story	I was never thought I'm watching one of best web series after money heist I love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😋😋😍😍😍😍
8	12 October 2021	samuelfpantoja	Pretty good	Like a lot of people I was told that this was a good show and should watch it, so I did and wasn't disappointed. It was full of mystery, action, suspense, and definitely emotion. Each episode was as good as the last and it all came to an epic conclusion. Although I won't spoil it. Anyway 8/10 would recommend.Although there was one problem, there were absolutely 0 squids!
5	20 September 2021	i-00086	The ending is disappointed	Seriously?8.3?The ending is absolutely illogical.
9	17 September 2021	xeffy	INTERESTING and Got Me Hooked	When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it.
10	19 September 2021	abhisheksinghrajput-60036	Suspence triller And dynamic	Series is good we fans are waiting for the season 2 hope so it will be available in short time.
6	11 October 2021	gwen_p	Good show, disappointing ending	This show was hyped so much I decided to watch it.I liked the series, and the thought behind it. But the ending really blew it for me.There are so many unanswered questions. Why did he dye his hair red? Why did he not board te plane? Why did it take him a year to help the brother and mother from the other players? What was the reason for the policeman's brother to join as foreman?I had high expectations, but the last episode was a huge disappointment.
4	17 September 2021	swcvqrpgx	BORING and didn't really meet our expectations.	The trailer is much much much more exciting than the actual series. The episodes are not as thrilling as promised and is filled with unnecessary conversations.. this is a waste of time. It does have good graphics though..
10	18 September 2021	abelgomezjr	BINGE WORTHY	Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha .
9	18 September 2021	chinh-51229	Amazing Series!	A true survival series and extremely suspenseful. Enjoy it, well worth it!!!
9	18 September 2021	parttimejobwaleindia	Powerful💪	Yes very unique content most powerful never miss. Most enjoyable.
10	18 September 2021	margotbrijs	REALLY GOOD SHOW!!!!	This show?! I have no words?! Really good 10/10!! I am amazed.
10	13 October 2021	lillykjones	Best show EVER	At first it kept being recommended on my Netflix didn't really care about it but bc it was 99% I was okay let's give it a try and I binged watched it. This show made me feel all differently types of ways and messed with my head but in a good way it was very well planed out and honestly I recommend it for everyone. The only bad thing is the VIPS it was weird I guess and it was very fake they had no personality except maybe creepy and that's it.
10	18 September 2021	privatebusiness	Blown Away with Jaw Dropping Moments!	Wow! This should an award series of 2021 in Netflix. The story does contain both funny and horror at the same time. In fact, those actors were all perfect for those roles and it really draws your attention to chase the episode like crazy!Even in these covid times, this film creator and director does know how to pull audiences with a mix of keeping the tradition but develop modern series!Thank you so much for this wonderful series!
7	18 September 2021	kieranoprey	Wish I could give 7.5 stars	The film making, characters, acting and premise was absolutely brilliant.I did find myself rolling my eyes more times than I'd hoped as characters made completely illogical decisions (I'm looking at you Ali) which conveniently fit the plot. I feel like it was cheap story telling that the writers thought the viewer wouldn't notice.The voice actors for the VIP's were horrific but hey it is a Korean series.Overall I'd give a 7.8.
10	20 September 2021	ntrkpt	I Really hope there's a second season and a third	This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling.
8	19 September 2021	tranhaidong	The film didn't make me disappointed	The show is great games in show is simple and easy for all people in the country religious to play but the show also has disadvantages that has a lot details that not make sense in show, also the plot twists are easy to predict. At this point Alice in Boderland is better.
8	21 September 2021	xrpredbull	a story about trust and relationship	There are three types of human relationships that squid game characters have.Type 1. The relationship between Deoksu (101) and his gang to obey by power.Type 2. Human relationships (218 and 1), such as Sang-woo (218), Il-nam (1), that give others to benefit from human relationships (218 and 1) succeeded in society, are intelligent, and elite)Type 3. Ki Hoon (456), Abdul Ali (199), sae byuk (67) and Ji Young (240) have pure trust (less social experience or unemployed)The best way to relate was to play the 4th game.A. saebyuk-Jiyoung, Deoksu-His subordinates were a team of the same type.Saebyuk and Jiyoung lived a difficult life as North Korean defectors and killers in society, but Jiyoung sacrifices for the saebyuk that opened her hand for the first time (Confrontation between Type 3)Deoksu and his subordinates usually work together, but they have no choice but to turn right away in extreme situations where they live only when they kill each other (Confrontation between Type 1)Deoksu's betrayal by his subordinates before entering the squid game immediately shows how easy human relationships are to be betrayed in extreme situations.B. Abdul Ali-Sangwoo, Ilnam-Kihoon were a team of different types of people.In the confrontation between Abdul Ali (199) and Sangwoo (218), Abdul Ali trusts Sangwoo until the end, but Sangwoo betrays and wins (Type 2 wins against Type 3).Sang-woo (218) gives Ali Abdul a bus fare, but I think he has changed in the same way as Type 2 as he has experienced a loss if he acts like 199 while adapting to society.-Ilnam (1) and Kihoon (456) are people who have lived opposite lives even in their numbers.Il-nam (No. 1) meets and plays with people like Ki-hoon (No. 456), who already makes a lot of money and feels demonstrated in life as he grows old, and gives no return, and feels joy in pure human relationships.Ki-hoon (456) gives a favor to Il-nam (1) and impresses the writing so that Il-nam loses on purpose (Type 3 wins Type 2)Ilnam (1) is a successful person in life, and he has lived in Type 2 way, and he seemed to think that it was right.Social life, socially high command and a lot of income people who think we should act in ways such as type 1 or type 2.I think I've experienced that type of people win while playing squid for a long time.The scene that shows this appears in the scene where vip bet 101 or 218 times as a favorite.Ki Hoon (456) was a person who overturned all of the above thoughts.-VIP didn't pick Kihoon (456) as the favorite.In the final, when Ki-hoon (456) tried to give up the money without stabbing him, Sang-woo was moved by Ki-hoon and committed suicide by admitting that his beliefs lost to Ki-hoon.Ilnam(1) has lost his mindset while playing the game.He lost to the type of person he thought was stupid who had stepped on to get a high position throughout his life.The last time Ilnam called Ki-hoon to play the game in the last episode seems to have tried to discuss Ki-hoon's reversal of his thoughts for the last time.Kihoon (456) met Ilnam at the end and played a game, and asked Ilnam, "I won now, right?"While playing the squid game, Ki-hoon showed ilnam that his thoughts were wrong as a result, but Ki-hoon doesn't seem to know that he did.It was a series that allowed people to reconsider human relationships by showing that people like Ki Hoon, who give trust and favor in no return, beat others.
8	19 September 2021	kayzelmorales	AS EXPECTED OF KOREAN ENTERTAINMENT	Pretty Entertaining.!!It's the first time I've seen Lee Jung-Jae in a series. I know this will be good. I've watched movies where he starred in and most of them are so good. If you liked Battle Royale, Saw, or any other Survival Movies/Series and enjoy plots that involve thinking, psychology and strategy , Do Not Miss this out.The Western actors though are so bad at acting.Warning : A scene contains flashing lights that may cause discomfort or trigger seizure for people sensitive to light.
10	19 September 2021	oliviaisabellagardner	10/10 would watch again	Was not expecting how deeply it makes you feel for all of the characters, there's a real connection you feel which makes you want them to win even more. Great plot with unexpected twists, would recommend this to everyone I know and anyone reading this.
3	12 October 2021	toviaandrew	I do not get the hype	I mean seriously this is it. This is why I hate listening to people before watching a movie. I had such high expectations for it, mostly when I heard it beats all Netflix series including Bridgerton, like someone actually had the nerve to say that. The first episode was the best; the only only one with the wow factor, then onwards the rest episodes were just filled with meaningless dialogues. Definitely not impressed.
9	20 September 2021	codyschlemmer	Squid Masterpiece	Wow, this show had me hooked from the first episode. I've never been able to watch dubbed shows before but this was an exception! Watched every episode last night... amazing story and actors. If this was a movie it probably would have seemed "cheesy" to many Americans. I'm so glad they made it a tv show with plenty of time to build the characters and get the story right!
9	20 September 2021	hanysyaza	RECOMMENDED!	RECOMMENDED. Finished this in one night. I cant stop watching it. Worth every episodes.
10	20 September 2021	saraazadahmad	WOW!	Honestly the best tv show i've ever watched. Recommend it definitely 100%. Everyone should watch it, I finished the whole season in a day and a half.
8	20 September 2021	spiroubarcelona	The squid financial game	Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives."Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? "Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore.
10	22 September 2021	karankumar-85603	It's a very great	Hey guys I'm karan and I belong to India and im 19 years old this series is great I like it all actors very good paforamce.
10	20 September 2021	nonchalantfrannie	Fly me to the moon	The show was epic!!!! But I want to know who sing that cover of fly me to the moon!!! I know that's not Renee olstead!!! Who is it!???
9	21 September 2021	perilo	very expressive	I'm Korean and felt sorry for the poor translation. The frontman and other masked people all spoke Korean in a strange way. I think the director deliberately created a bizarreness through the horrible acting of people involved in the game including VIPs.
4	21 September 2021	fakem-29395	Only the first EP is good after that it started raining "Plot holes"	First of all , lets appreciate the aesthetics and the colors of the movie.Now lets make it clear that this concept is not new , its very similar to "Kaiji" an anime series I really loved , I started to get flashbacks from "kaiji" specially when I saw the VIPs and the bridge scene . I don't mind the similarity because I really liked how the move started The first EP was perfect but after that it became a rip off of a great anime series like "kaiji" , The plot holes started from the police man when he sneaked under the car like how is that possible? , and then he passed all the security . How the hell there's no cameras everywhere , why they didn't put cameras in the bathroom and a lot of other small rooms, and the most ridiculous thing they didn't put cameras on the boss's room . A lot of minutes were wasted with that 'wanna be detective' police officer , I really hated him since I saw him and I was waiting for his death .
9	21 September 2021	raphaelfortin	Surprising	I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly.
9	21 September 2021	comical_tube	Overall I enjoyed it	It made me shed a few tears, not gonna lie. But it's a great show for being a Netflix Original.
6	21 September 2021	serpentinestorm	It could have been a solid 8.	This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the "protagonist", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the "hero of the story" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.
10	21 September 2021	ninapark-59952	Netflix, please make the season 2!	WOW, there are so much twists, action, suspense, drama, and messages all packed in 9 episodes. It is hard to stop watching once you started. One of the best Netflix show ever. I really like the ending.
2	22 September 2021	jolu7	You'll lose brain cells watching this.	Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and "deep" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).Many scenes are plain cliché/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the "bad guy" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a "good guy"? Ridiculous.The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells.
10	22 September 2021	mattsmith-51480	GGANBU WOW	Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.More, more, more please.
7	23 September 2021	mrloetter	Fun with some disappointing bits (SPOILERS)	It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make "cool" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes.
10	26 September 2021	loysegfro	Nothing but amazing	The plot:10/10Characters: 10/10. Cast:10/10Everything was amazing. It is pretty short but a lot happened. Its a rollercoaster of emotions. Definitely recommend.
10	23 September 2021	malibuboobz	Binged it in one night	I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show.
10	23 September 2021	tihonhontitihon	I really love it	The best K Netflix Series I've seen recently.Hope they will release season 2 and 3 and moreeeee!!
8	24 September 2021	kaankicimsit	Most Unexpected TV Show!	I've never watched a series like this before. From the characters behavior's stand due the game time to pains in their civil life is effect your brain in the existential sense way. They show us mankind could do everything for some stupid piece of paper with a small games that we played in our childhood. On the other hand as the games progress, you witness other games played behind the scenes and the taste of the series starts to get better. Omg! I don't want to give you spoiler! Just watch it. I hope the second season will airs.
9	24 September 2021	naimnorazmi	A Modern Literature	Poetic yet Gruesome, the story shows the harsh reality of the world through a fictional series, modern slavery. They director succesfully make the audience to have roller coaster of emotions: suspense,relief,grief. They also give attention to small details that made the story truly brings out. The actors also played their role really well, enough that bond were built between the audience and the actors.
9	27 September 2021	adonisdane	Engaging Show!	The overall series is very accurate and interesting will make your interest on high octane edge. The actors have done a brilliant job, Character developments are also so impressive and fantastic. The makers should need to season 2 as soon as possible because It's been a long time since I've seen something new. Therefore, it should be taken forward.
9	24 September 2021	madeliefdehaan	Fantastically horrific	One of the greatest shows I have seen in years. The VIP actors ruïned some parts unfortunately.
10	24 September 2021	theokon-74073	Amazing Show, but stupid VIP's	The switch from game to Vip lost my suspense a bit, as well as the Vip's couldn't act.But other than that an amazing nail biting show with amazing sets and actors.
6	24 September 2021	adhitiya-95828	Guilty.	The acting, and graphic was good, the cast's acting me have no complain at all, its awesome, me love it.But, how about the story? Well, I would say the whole story was good, but there is some part that confusing, there is a lot of detail that need to be explained, I hope they explain the details in next season.
10	24 September 2021	bradyy-58264	Great show but it messed with me	It's super dark and intriguing and shows the lengths different humans will go out of greed. Messed with me a lot though sheesh.
10	1 October 2021	wifiandmusic	Fantastic Show!!!	Honestly, this show puts a new meaning to Korean series. My boyfriend always thoughts my obsessions was in vain but come on! Even he admits this show is fire.
8	25 September 2021	tw-87529	Binge Worthy Gorefest with amazing characters	Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show.
3	25 September 2021	hastyt	A story about morals and hypocrisy	I don't know what to feel about this movie series. The main protagonist questioning the morality of others, where he obviously lacked it when he cheated against the old man (pre-character reveal). And still he continues to question the morality of the game even when it just started, it is already clear that you have to surrender your morality in order to survive.I also have to fast-forward some drama moments because they are very cliché to be honest.
10	25 September 2021	byronb-44985	Gripping	What an amazing series taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, we couldn't stop watching it. I agree with the other viewers that the VIP acting was rubbish but equally I think they are meant to represent caricatures of the most vile people who enjoy killing for sport. Wow the acting though from the Korean cast is first rate and the story line has a deeper message for all of us. Episode 6 had me wrecked!
10	25 September 2021	michaelhirte	Gripping	It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season.
10	26 September 2021	hoanganhyournewfriend	Best capture of humanist heart!	I rarely write reviews but this show is bingeworthy, it gots me laughing, crying at the same times and the color of the movie, those actors' acting skills were heart-touching, spectacular I must say. I guess I was a bit confused due to the last episode but to dig deep down inside the main character, he has a really warm heart from the moment that he fed a cat to the moment that he stop the game for his friend, so I guess it has never been easy for him to use that money immidiately. And after seeing the death of 455 players, it is understandable why he didn't choose to break his daughter's new family in LA (which can be considered as paradise) but come back to Hell Joseon as a new human-being (when ppl change their hair color, it means that they want to be a new them) to maybe get revenge for his friend or change the whole system of the game ^^? Can't wait to know what will happen next so please release season 2 the sooner the better!!!!
10	26 September 2021	dumimadikane	One of the best shows to recently come out	There's something about Korean shows on Netflix always hitting the gold spot. Furthermore, so excited for another season.
1	27 September 2021	deathglass	Trash through and through	Complete garbage soap, shallow and vapid characters, interactions, dialogue, garbage cinematography and picture quality, godawful choreography and camerawork. Scenes and setting both looking like haphazard trash, while also being excessively extended and serving no purpose at all. The show simply capitalizes on vulgarity and shock factor to attract lowbrow audiences.
10	27 September 2021	lukeamsanchez	Wow, I Felt Like I Was Watching An Anime	Seriously this show was like watching an anime. I saw that the director did name a couple of mangas that inspired him but I was shocked this wasn't based of a manga by the same name and story. Really addicting to watch. I see all the other reviews on here dumping on the VIP's but I'll add this... While the acting was atrocious, you're not supposed to like them. In this day in age, villains are always sexy/relatable. I choose to believe the terrible acting helps break the illusion of a "bad ass" or a "sexy villain". So maybe you can see it that way as well. I have a bigger gripe with...and I'll spoiler mark this*Spoiler****-that one VIP got held at gun point and knocked out but he didn't even so much as complain about it to frontman.. TF? At least mention it. I was left hanging there like... So he's cool with that happening to him even though he's "hard to satisfy" and was attempting to be this bad dude with impossibly high standards? But that's my only gripe so I still give it a 10!
9	27 September 2021	blxezy	Live laugh love... and witness murder...	Spoilers (sort of?)The reason I gave this a star down is purely the fact that all the good hearted people dying got me so depressed. However, I should have expected that. But aside from that everything was amazing! The story line stays entertaining throughout the whole season and only gets better. I'd watched this a thousand times over.
9	27 September 2021	shaikhkaleem-66657	Must watch fabulous web series Korea is very good content	Every actor is fantastic performanceGreat story great direction all best.
9	27 September 2021	arthiee	Good one	Very interesting movie and the game seems easy yet super tricky. My favourite part is the honeycomb game.
4	27 September 2021	mosaba-45679	Interesting story but no suspense and easy to predict what next	On first episode meeting the girl who stole his money was a mistake from the director because it showed how easy I could predict what happens next . Last episode has many faultsI enjoyed the series but I hoped the scenario would be smarter than what I saw 😔
10	27 September 2021	farkasovasabina	Squid game review	An amazing movie I love him. I recommend it to peek it's great so I recommend take a look.
5	27 September 2021	leandrimfih	Totally disappointed by the reviews from here.	Seriously, you guys really didn't know who was behind it? Didn't you really figure out very early on who the Leader was? Every plot of this show was outrageously announced by the director/acting. I give it a 5 because the idea is excellent! Out of the box. But the execution was terrible. It is a very serious mistake to let the viewer know the most important plot of the show in the FIRST EPISODE!!!!!I understand the folks with grades 9, 10. I believe there is a little more repertoire missing.
1	28 September 2021	cwmsxmsm	Extremly pointless waste of korean time	Just a silly scenario, with a big investment, and a cheesy end. Please stop comparing it to Casa de Papel.
10	29 September 2021	kbrinsfield	Fantastic!	I hate movies/shows with subtitles but, I absolutely loved this show!!
1	29 September 2021	iamdufan	Korean version of HUNGER GAMES!!!	At some scenes, the actors are overacting. The cinematography is not too good. There is a nonsense part, where they play that rope game, why the old man's hands gotta be locked if he was the maker of this game? And yeah, they not supposed to be blame each other players in that arena! The ending is just ruined all the previous episode. Peoples need to see hunger games before they say that this is the best korean series -_-
1	29 September 2021	fmgqjdcnr	Copycat.	This movie is sooooo overrated, it's a blatant plagiarism from Japanese movies like "As the Gods will", "Liar Game", "Friend Game", and the final twist is a piece of a popular series name Saw.The director of the film even stated that As The Gods Will was created in the 2010s, after his initial idea for Squid Game, but if he had to say it, he would say he did it first.Seriously? He make a movie that has a lot of stuff copied from movies that came out years ago and say he made it first by his idea?!? You think audiences are stupid?You create something after someone else, you have to make it different otherwise you are just a copycat of other people's work and effort. You can't just copied and say "I made it first because I had the idea in mind first." It's ridiculous!Stealing other people's work and make it your own it's dirty and unacceptable in the modern world, a really talented, self-respecting director would definitely never do that.
8	29 September 2021	beautyatl	LOVE THIS SHOW! NEEDS TO BE RECREATED IN USA & NOLLYWOOD	I thought it was just something to put on but I ended up watching it twice 😍
0	29 September 2021	krabexbaba	Help	HOW DO I START THE EPISODEEE???????!!!!!Just enibodey help me whit this plissss.
9	30 September 2021	beautbrightmind	THE SYMBOLISMS WERE SO GOOD	1. The red jumpsuit of the numbers - symbolizes they are like a colony of red ants. They work together but when one person is gone, it won't be a big deal and they can easily be replaced by another ant or in their case, another number. I think them being a red ant instead of being a black ant (apart from looking friendly or light) also insinuates that they're the more aggressive ones (they're the ones that kill off people) since red ant's bite is harsher than a black ant's.2. The masks - symbolize that the numbers work for the players but the irony is also that they don't WORK for the players. They are not controlled by the players because the players are not the ones actually in charge of the games.3. The ladders in the lobby - symbolize social hierarchy that we need to climb as we progress to the society. As the players move to the games, they climb up the ladder, meaning they're reaching a higher hierarchy because they are gaining more money through playing.4. The ribboned / present-like casket - the art director said that this symbolizes that the creator views themselves as a god that has given the players the chance to change their life. Their money was a present from them and their death is also a present from them.This show just have the perfect tone, pace, setting, and depth.
3	30 September 2021	ongioicaudayruine	Disappointed	The movie tries to show the humanity but doesn't really make sense.
9	11 October 2021	verstaenquentin	The best serie at the moment	The story is set in secret Island. It is about of a group of people who risk their lives in a mysterious game of survival with a reward of 45,6 billions won (32 million euro).My opinion about this series, I think it's one of the best serie that I have seen. It holds in suspence and we can't wait to know the end. I recommend it to you 100 %, looking forward to the second season.
7	2 October 2021	kiniabator	It's good but emotionally draining	I've watches it all in one night and it was good, but it was killing me emotionally trough all episodes so the last two I essentially just skipped trough. I'm not sure if it was worth it, it's a good psychological thriller though.
10	30 September 2021	thichuyen-04606	ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT	This show is very deep and meaningful. There's life lessons you can learn from watching this. It's suspenseful and gruesome. I finished 9 episodes in 2 days and almost dislocated my jaw. Loved it and hoping for Season 2!
9	30 September 2021	mohcenehani	Great serie	The korean drama always impresse us.you just have to watch it.
10	1 October 2021	selinazh	Watch with s	Definitely in my Top 3 of K-Dramas. Just watch in Korean with subtitles because dubbed versions are never authentic and just so cringey (in general, please watch your shows in the original language).And yes, the VIPs were horrible but luckily they only played a small role. However, the main actors were incredible and definitely deserve an award!
9	1 October 2021	htrrm	Amazing show! Awful translation	I feel I'm quite hard to please when it comes to to shows and movies, but this was really really great to watch. Never wanted it to endThe subtitles/dub don't match up so it's kind of take your pick what you want to translate it all as but it doesn't take anything away from the actual show.
8	1 October 2021	emilyshipley-08579	Ali	Ali deserved better and that's all that needs to be said :,(
1	1 October 2021	salljou	revive saebyeok	...very bad show angry emoji* dont watch, i only watched so saebyeok would win but..cursing at you emoji* hwang dong hyuk im coming after you.
10	1 October 2021	bbtwmmd	Best ever Korean drama even VIPs did very bad acting	Squid Game reflects Korean society very deeply. All characters could be found in real Korean society. Worth watching! Only minus was very bad VIPs acting.
4	5 October 2021	halit-62377	Uncle is dead :(	It was sad that your uncle died in the series. I expected your uncle not to die and win.
9	1 October 2021	hlmcbride	Slow to start but stick with it	I found the beginning of the first episode to be extremely slow paced and I instantly disliked the main character I was seconds from turning it off and giving up on this show but then finally...... bam! It gets interesting and extremely bloody and thrilling and I couldn't stop watching and found myself often wondering what I would do if in their situation. The main character became less annoying and I eventually grew to enjoy him as a character and really rooting for him. I actually guessed the twist very earliest but enjoyed it none the less. Do not watch it you can't stand senseless violence, blood or are squeamish.
6	8 October 2021	Pdiggitydawgg	Meh.	Wasn't planning on watching this series but all my friends and colleagues have been talking about it and I wanted to be able to discuss it with them, given the hype.It was alright, not worth the hype honestly.1st off, the costumes are a complete rip-off of Money Heist. 2nd, the story is basically the hunger games but in Korean. Thirdly, the ending wasn't good. Lots of things didn't add up and loose ends left.I actually lost interest around the 7th or 8th episode but stuck with it to see what happened. Not much, is the answer.If you want a better foreign series to tuck into I suggest 'The Chestnut Man'.
1	1 October 2021	dedahany	Sucks	Boring and sucks.You will waste your time, it should be 1 star rating.
1	2 October 2021	enhtseren	The most overrated Korean dramatic adventurousish series	Dramatic uniform, dramatic instagrammable masks. The plot is so forced. Nothing is thrilling. Too overrated i think.
10	2 October 2021	piyushmohabe	Great Show 10/10!	Must Watch if you're interested in horror/dark scenes.
4	2 October 2021	pinkshujo	Biasa aja	Biasa aja overhype series.basic gore series. Not worth to watch. They should make it movie not series.
8	2 October 2021	jason-49110	Intacto 2001 Spanish film "inspiration"?	Firstly this is a great series - probably the best Korean series I have watched (and I love Korean series').HOWEVER, I had this strange feeling in the back of my mind the whole time watching Squid Game, that I had seen this somewhere before, many years earlier in a Euro movie starring Max Von Sydow.Anyone else seen INTACTO?
1	2 October 2021	umarrashid-37770	Korean hungergames copy	Brings nothing new to an already over saturated genre.
1	2 October 2021	leanahx	The worst series	The worst series ive ever watched i swear it is so bad and awful !!!Like how can you enjoy watching such thing seriously? I wasted my time watching it 🤢
8	4 October 2021	moatazelmeliegy	Mix between Parasite and The Platform	The psychological dimension of the script is well written. Once you know the new game u can figure out what will happen next. The story is somehow acceptable Acting is good, not great. The best part for me is in Episode 5 when the game manager is speaking about the equality.
10	2 October 2021	lovegrovecharles	Never saw it coming	I have enjoyed alot of films and I find predictablity destroys a film. Now days hollywood goes so far to try and throw people that it has become predictable and frankly unbelieveable. But with this series I found myself on the edge of my seat questioning everything and genuinely and believeably caught of guard. Its not just brilliantly written and visually impressive but the ethical turmoil will make you reflect on the very foundation of human morals in a way I have never seen before. Very very good visuals, brilliantly told story and refreshing.
8	2 October 2021	prathmeshnaiknaware	Great show, but	It was very predictable. I predicted death of the last girl, survival of old man and many more..
9	2 October 2021	doboszalan	Amazing show, great acting by the protagonists	I didn't have any expectations as I hadn't read or heard any reviews of the show. I've seen the show pop up every day on my Netflix page and I'm glad I ended up watching it. The stage set, the storyline shows another level of creativeness which is rare nowadays. All in all great show, in my opinion it would be best for it to leave it as it is, without a second season...
1	3 October 2021	eatonellie	Dark, twisted, depressing, and yet incredibly boring	This deeply dark and disturbing show dragged on for nine hours, nine damn hours - for what? To show us billionaires shouldn't exist, poverty causes desperation, and capitalism sucks? Really? We needed a poorly conceived none hour saga to show us that? No.The writer was not only a nihilist, but also constantly spelled out everything the audience is shown - leaving nothing clever, nothing subtle, and nothing original.I'm very concerned about how well rated this show is. Truly. Y'all concern me.
10	3 October 2021	shubhamyadav-20776	In 4th game..My heart get melted	Love it. I really liked it . And if you want a suspense you can watch it. I will recommend it.
10	3 October 2021	dhamalesagar	Fabulous	It's the best korian series ever, what can i say. Absolutely fabulous.
10	3 October 2021	giannivila	A very high adrenaline show	The show has a plot that focuses on multiple people who are in a financial crisis, that engage in a death game with the last person standing winning a lot of cash. The way the games are done builds up anticipation of what is to come next , leaving audiences on the edge of fear and anxiety until eventually it unfolds into shock , as they see that in these games no life is spared. As for the actors , every actor does a great job of playing each character that has their own unique character traits . Overall , in my honest opinion everything was executed wonderfully from the music , the cinematography , plot , characters , and much more. Truly , if you haven't watch the show yet I promise that if you do watch it , you will be stunned by it and will be left wanting to see more.
10	3 October 2021	baileynonose	Amazing series	Definitely best watched in Korean with English subtitles.Incredible acting, great story line, have already watched twice and will probably watch again. Plenty of little moments that add to the story.
10	3 October 2021	DEAF8LKT888	awesome actors is South Korea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Warning graphic violence Warning....when watching your favorite will addiction on tv show whole 9 episodes is great on Netflix.
10	4 October 2021	rbroek-30704	Never ever gave something a 10/10, but here it is.	Just an artistic rollercoaster.The idea is so simple, but the execution is masterful.It got so much depth to it, unbelievable.
10	4 October 2021	raeabot	10/10 but the vips	They just suck. Everything about them is just bad, they were build up to be so cool but so disappointed.
9	4 October 2021	michalfilipovicz	Here a so cool film but one problem here a bad words.	SO HALAL MODE. Here a so perfect film but one problem, bad words 9/10.
9	4 October 2021	Acalyn	A thought-provoking, fast-paced drama with everything to offer	Squid Game is one of the most popular TV series of 2021 so I decided I would try it out. The show completely captured me when it came to the drama between the characters and the intensity of the games. I recommend this show if you're interested in a fast-paced, drama series that will leave you on the edge of your seat and will make you think at the same time. This show is relentless and graphic so it's not for the faint of heart. For nine episodes, Hwang Dong-hyuk captured many facets of humanity and the world as we know it.Characters:I enjoyed many of the characters and the acting was phenomenal. At first I criticized Gi-Hun for being a gambler but as the series went on it showed his tragic downfall and the lack of job security in South Korea. I don't know much about South Korea but I imagined it to be somewhat more prosperous than America. No, everywhere is cruel, I learned, as the world showed Ali's kindness taken advantage of and the ending bet with the man in the snow. I loved Sae-Byeok and I cried when her friend gave up her life for her. I even felt some remorse for Player 218, or Sangwoo, when he was lying in the rain, completely jaded, the rain crashing down on him on the realization on what he did. Each character has their moment and I felt for each one of them.**Themes:The themes are what make this show beautiful. Gi-Hun and Sang-woo being foils of each others was well-executed. I kept asking myself the question, is Sang-woo wrong? He had to kill those people to survive. He had to push the man in glass hopskotch or the others wouldn't have made it. He did what he had to do to survive, and yet we critcize him because we think it's what we wouldn't have done. But we would we to survive? And then the war of poverty and tragedy with all the characters was honest but heart-breaking to see. Ali still had to break his morals and hurt a man to receive his salary for his family. 067 or Sae-Byeok pickpocketed because she had nothing else to resort to - after all, she was an illegal alien from North Korea. We don't know why Sang-woo fought (he had only his mother left) but he wanted to restore himself instead of admit he was not the pride of his hometown.**CriticismsMany plot threads go nowhere. Doctor sub-plot was pointless, although I was still chilled by the Front-man's lack of respect for the Player's body. Also, the Morse Code wasn't mentioned again unless it was relevant to the Doctor subplot.Jun-ho effortlessly managing to get into Squid Island. Would have been interesting if they had intentionally let him raid it and kill him afterward (after all, who can be blamed if everyone remains anon. This man broke the rules so many times but the most he got was a slap on the wrist? What is the point of the rules for the employees then if the only enforced rules are the masks?The plot twist with Jun-ho finding out the Front Man was his brother. An extreme plot hole considering the beginning (mentioned by mrloletter) when Jun-ho was paying his brother's rent for only a month. His brother wasn't missing that long. But then later we find out that he won in 2015(?), so 5 years before the show began. So I guess the brother is a bit older than him but holy crap the Front Man looks considerably older. I didn't really understand the plot twist. Maybe the Front-Man will feel bad that he killed his brother? It showed that he did feel some remorse and that he was willing to save his brother. Since we don't understand the Front Man's motivations this scene was very odd.The VIPs. The acting was horrible and ruined my immersion in the show.The EndingPersonally I really loved the ending. Many don't like how Gi-Hun turns into a strawberry but I liked the symbolism, albeit it was way too obvious. He had lost his mother, explaning why he didn't go straight to his daughter. Even though he had won he still felt like he had failed. That he was too late. The worst feeling in the world. He felt like he was a horrible person and didn't know what to say to his daughter (remember that he still hit her stepfather and never explained it to her). Even with him calling the number and saying that "I'm a threat" was a bit interesting since it leads on to a Season 2, and also shows he still has some fight left in him.Player One being the founder was an odd twist but I still liked it since it exposed who he was as a person and his attitudes toward the poor (being deserving). Playet One was honest at the games telling Gi-Hun, his gganbu, his reasons, his motivations, and even his greatest weaknesses. He still loved Gi-Hun in some way that I still liked his character (even though he's a horrible person).Overall I'm excited for Season 2 and what to come. Squid Game is absolutely amazing!
9	4 October 2021	daveburger-24478	Good serie	It's a good serie to watch and it has a good story if you just dont think about what's gonna happen.
10	5 October 2021	tellustodo	Extremely Well Directed Thriller	Its a best 21st Century watch, it has technology, drama, thrill, action, dramedy, gore and what not . . . Impressive work by the Koreans.
5	5 October 2021	emilyanime-09711	A bit boring lots of plot holes	Personally I found squid game a bit boring and sort of emotionless. I watched Alice in borderland soon after it came out, last year and I loved that and thought I'd probably like squid game. But I must say I much preferred Alice in borderland, the characters were far more gripping and showed much more emotion. Out of the dramas I've watched recently (I'll include Alice in borderland); Vincenzo, Sweet Home, Alice in borderland and Squid game. Squid game is definitely my least favourite.It had a lot of plot holes and it didn't really seem to go anywhere. Squid game has definitely got too much hype.If you want a really good drama to watch, go watch Vincenzo. It's absolutely amazing and has a really interesting premise which it pulls off perfectly. "Chef's kiss".
1	5 October 2021	gyawalisamikshyak	Not worth the buzz	How could this becomes a hit, do people like this much of violence, this series is so cruel.
10	5 October 2021	KingKram22	Amazing	Wow! Loved every minute of this show. Original, gripping, and heart wrenching.Am I the only one who thought the VIP's were actually a piss take on what Koreans think of rich, arrogant and obnoxious Americans? Well, I thought it was great.This show will stay with me and it's meanings behind it (whatever you individually take out of it). It is definitely up there as one of my all-time favourites.So good.
7	5 October 2021	night_devils-76022	Overrated. Comedy and drama show for adults.	.Nice and creative story, but failed to deliver it as a horror or thriller show..Too many long , boring and silly conversations.
10	5 October 2021	nourelislam-01072	Great bonita	Good. It is a good series.esta muy bien.and It was so satisfying.
9	5 October 2021	qiujustinaurelio	Probably the best death game show	The setting was standard for a death game show, but the main characters' writing was splendid, and there is character growth which is rare.
6	5 October 2021	radicalex	Such a disappointment	The overall show was pretty cool but the ending is such a let down. The main character seems to hate himself so much that he cares nothing for his family or his life. Such a disappointment we could have ended it with him having a wonderful life with his daughter and starting season 2 brand new..... what were the writers thinking.
9	5 October 2021	a-56553-67381	good	It's good to grasp the tears and refreshing points. The pinball level did poke the tears, and then it did arouse some thoughts. Is it necessary to pay a down payment for ten years, and then carry a mortgage for thirty years until retirement.
4	5 October 2021	Lobstaar	Overrated..	I don't think it's worth the hype, the games were overall boring and dragged out far too long.I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable, some were just outright annoying from the off.It's probably worth a watch if you've nothing else, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression like any other series of similar storyline.
9	5 October 2021	eggheader1	Bloody good	This show draws you in and it keeps you hooked. The acting and character development is so good that you truly feel for the characters, which makes their demise that much more heart wrenching.
10	5 October 2021	scania-27815	Binge Watched the Entire Season in one go.	The season was amazing from start to finish. I couldn't stop watching it I watched it one go. The English dubbing though it terrible doesn't fit the actors as it's all American accents so I recommend Korean with English subtitles. Hopefully they'll do a second season.
10	13 October 2021	drpeterboles	Tasteless illegal achievements	I spent one day watching the 9 episodes really amazingUnexpected boss in episode 9Waiting for their second season.A new money heist like series from netflix people will wait every year but don't make it stretched episodes as the last couple if seasons of money heist.
9	6 October 2021	zombieprinsess	Absolutely amazing	I have never written an IMDB review, but this show is an exception. Amazing acting (except the VIPs), thrilling plot, and breathtaking cinematography. I had to hold my breath during a lot of the scenes from the suspense! Truly remarkable and well done.It's literally all great except for the VIPs. Their acting is so bad and they really are not great characters. Pompous white people with snooty and rude behaviors. Show didn't need them and would've gotten a 10 without them. Beyond that, watch this. You won't regret it!
10	6 October 2021	bhuang-97225	Great show	Hoyeon's acting was amazing.VIP acting was atrocious.
10	6 October 2021	Arashbahmaninik	Great job from Korean Director	As a director I enjoyed so much (frame by frame)everything was complete and enough!I gave you 10 golden star for this production and waiting for the next season.Great job everyone!
5	6 October 2021	Filmbuff314	Disappointingly mundane	Meh, Despite great performances from the Korean cast, this series failed to impress... Oh, don't get me wrong, I watched every episode back to back as if binge eating a tube of Pringles but where am I after spending 9 hours of my life on this? Like a bad lay, I'm feeling a little cheated tbh - after an interesting hook, it failed to develop its theme to maturity. By the end you'll have yourself for watching for the only reason of "who'll die next?" I'd personally like my 9 hours back.
10	6 October 2021	saleemkouzali-54256	Adhshsjdbbsjsbsbdb	Best ever and very good that the best series eve.nzjzjzjsmskzjxndnxdjjsjsjsnsbdbdhdhdhebdbdbdbdbdbd.

10	7 October 2021	schanpreet-82185	Amazing.....literally Mind blowing	Series full of suspense and thrill.....but subtitles were not up to the mark.
7	7 October 2021	parajesh-36498	Worth it to watch it	I saw it with English dubbing, but I don't think I connected with it at all. The build-up to the tale is fantastic, and it's always fun to watch a suspense game series. I liked it, but I wasn't as impressed with the finish as I was with the beginning.
7	7 October 2021	dimtjunk	It was ok, but they killed it with the last episodes.	For those who remember the episode of Breaking Bad with the fly. The last episodes were just like that, long dialogue without true story development and not much happening. In my opinion that killed it for me, I was really disappointed. Other then that, I recommend.
7	7 October 2021	Zizidogg	Could be better	This show is good but overhyped. What are white people so excited about this show? Asians dying? That's sick in the head if you ask me.
8	7 October 2021	sisokels	Awesome!	Go watch it if you haven't, it's sure to keep you hooked. The last episode though was not it. Aside that it's a great story, cast, act and music too.

10	7 October 2021	bowmanfamily-30516	Amazing	I really don't know what the fuss is about? Squid games plays everything every normal person wants to see. It's amazing and well done to the producers. Squid games is living proof once you have failed never give up hope!It also shows how desperate people are to get out of debt something that society should review.
10	8 October 2021	stevenmonkeydishwasher	Amazing TV Show without Western BS	Man I almost forgot what it was like to watch a show that's pure escapism and not Preachy at all, no Politically correct western BS here, no forcing Trans people down our throats, no throwing in some artificially diverse cast, no overly feminist BS, so refreshing to watch a show with a great concept that isn't ruined by Western ideology, I've never watched a South Korean show before but may start being my new favorites.
5	8 October 2021	jaxefe	Strong start, lousy finish	I did enjoy first three episodes for setting up the tone, but past those show drags on, I don't think story was fleshed out beyond there's this room and people play games in it and if they lose they die. Ending is also.lackluster, you expect it to reveal the motives for this game but the answer you get is unsatisfying to say the least.Also, from the ending episode seems like they're setting up for another season, but frankly, I don't think there's much left to tell in regards to the story, and I fear like with most decent series it will devolve into The Walking Dead.variant of the Squid Game, where they renew for the new seasons and only then start working on the story and I doubt that's enough time to write a captivating story, nonetheless, I wish them good luck. For first three episodes alone, I'd say it's worth a watch.
10	8 October 2021	sharonvandalen	Insanely Good!	Wow, I finished the serie in a week. I loved it so much! The storyline is great, the cast is awesome everything is just great!On Netflix you can choose in which language you wanna hear it, please choose Korean cause it sounds better and it´s the original language of course. (Just a tip) :)Have fun watching it!
4	8 October 2021	olemarborg	Overrated.	Bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot. The only person in the whole production who knew what they were doing was the cinematographer!The acting was over the top, from all the actors, not just the English-speaking ones. Dialog was bad and mostly exposition. Tv is a visual medium, show don't tell! And last but not least the plot wich came with no surprises, even tho it tried really hard. The whole story, not just the ending, was way too easy to predict. After episode 2, all the excitement was gone, and the rest was just a snooze fest.
8	9 October 2021	mcooper-63143	Richard Bachman	For those of more mature years, familiar with Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), this will resonate...re: Long Walk, Running Man.Only watched episode 1 in Korean with English subtitles, but I did enjoy it. I hope that this continues.
1	9 October 2021	mkczsjr	Overhype central, this needs some negative reviews so bad.	This is a complete insult to the saw series. Old man with brain tumour plays sick games on vulnerable people? Remember? Acting, shocking. Everything has to be a binge series these days, but Christ, if you made it through the second episode of this wanting more, without the apprehended hype then you need a medal for perseverance. I'm done.
9	12 October 2021	abhishekvpai-74751	Squid games review.	Honestly, one of the best series to watch. The most unexpected twist is the old man. I just loved this series. I would say one of the best series released this year. Worth to watch.
5	10 October 2021	guruism-69711	Just another mediocre show..Not worth the hype at all	First of all, I can't understand why does this show have 8.3 IMBD rating. I am assuming that the audience who have reviewed it are mostly those who haven't watched many series / movies of this genre.All in all it's s just another series with some Psychopath killing every person who is not able to win / survive a game but with a mix of emotions and drama. If you are thinking that this is a series filled with thrilling chilling moments at every step, you are mistaken. The first episode made me think that this could be a bit different but by the third episode I was wondering why am I even watching it. Every now and then, there will be useless drama, emotional dialogues explaining why each character is playing this game, what their monetary problems are and why they want to get the prize money at any cost. Many useless dialogues and excessive emotional drama that do not make any sense in this kind of series. Side plot stories that lead to nowhere in the end. Lead character is dumb and remains dumb till the end. Acting by the cast is okayish but it deteriorates drastically by the last two episodes. This series is not worth your time. If you like watching psychological thrillers where people get massacred then there are many way better than this like The Collection, Saw Series, Get Out(2017), Final Destination series etc.But if you want to watch it anyways because of the hype or because of your interest in what the hell these games are, skip to the following timestamps for these episodes and you will be satisfied -Episode 1: full episodeEpisode 2: Ignore. Everyone is just a cry baby. No games in this one.Episode 3: After 28:00Episode 4: After 39:58Episode 5: Till 02:20, no games in this one. Just a dumb side story.Episode 6: Start at 14:56. This is the most boring one and unfortunately the game takes up the whole episode. Watch this at 1.5x speed.Episode 7: After 17:57, this has a little bit of thrilling momentsEpisode 8: 17:07 to 26, no games but important for the last episode.Episode 9: first 20 mins.
10	10 October 2021	berniescicluna-74171	Keeps you on the edge of your seat!	A Geat series after many years!! Must Watch. Would like to see season 2.. Cant wait.
10	10 October 2021	aman-08425	Best web series i have ever seen	In episode i actually cried . That the power of this series. We feel same emotions what the series want us to feel.
10	10 October 2021	zaad-27407	Love it	I wasn't love the Korean drama but this is amazing!How did they wrote it how did they made it wow!
9	10 October 2021	ferjadiam	very nive movie👌	Its a nice game thought i didnt finish to watch it i think its a nice movieyou.
1	10 October 2021	calummcguigan	Muck brown	I had to create an account to announce my disdain for this, I have no idea what people think is good TV anymore, I imagine that the sort that love this probably camp out to watch each fast and furious film, you know the type, its bland its predictable and nothing new, blown out of proportion by the Facebook and tiktok crowd. Drivel, I'd sooner watch paint dry than watch this again, or have my eyeballs resurfaced. I can't express how dull this is enough, do yourself a favour and avoid it, unless you love the fast and furious then you'll be all over this.
7	13 October 2021	enzodellasantafilho	overrated	Squid game it's a good show, but the marketing and hype around is overrating this serie, making some people how's gonna watch create too much expectation.
1	10 October 2021	christinaejani	Worst scenario	I am 35+ and during the last decade I see people getting obsessed about pain, kills. Really how u can find that scenario interesting? It is all about pain, physicians mentally. If people enjoy this kind of series then something is not going well in our society ...
2	10 October 2021	jrswhymgq	As if Tarantino shot this - after a major stroke	What a huge disappointment. I wanted to keep on going but had to stop watching after 6 episodes, so if there actually was a point to this series, I did not stay long enough to learn it.This show tries to be very graphic and to shock you with how little can human life be valued while at the same time desperately (10x per episode) attempts to attack your deeper emotions. Almost all of the characters are either extremely annoying or disgusting.No thanks.
9	14 October 2021	storjasson	A great show to entertain	Squid game is definitely a great show to binge watch. Plot is good and great characters and good ending. The best thing about Squid games is it's unpredictability. Anything can happen anytime which hooks the viewers.
10	11 October 2021	elvinduclos	The best Korean Serie!	Normally, I'm not a big fan of Korean series and music. But here I have to say well done to the director and the actors of this series. I'm not a big fan of series in general, because I never get hooked and get bored very easily. So I am someone who watches a lot of film and hardly ever a series. This time around is the first time I've "LOVED" a series and hooked it from start to finish. The story is original and it feels like a kind of hunger game, with characters who are in dire straits and who fight until the end to win a huge amount of money. The fact that the series is really different from all the other series is that it has its own universe, its own setting. Watching this series is like a drug. We are addicted and we want more, we want to know more things. We easily get attached to the characters because we pity them enough. And I think it's a good lesson in morale, this series certainly represents, a little exaggerated, today's society. I can only advise you. If I had to give this series a rating, it would be 19/20 because season 2. We can't wait !!
6	11 October 2021	amirhosseinesmailzade	OK but not the best - over rated	Visible Korean series with almost good characterization and interesting and non-repetitive storyThis series, which today has become famous and viral only with Netflix commercials, cyberspace, money, has made every person one of the most watched series just because of the words of the community and people and because of the culture shock It has become one of the most watched series But have you ever wondered how popular this series would have been if it weren't for the commercials? Just like the series because of under rated BB Being canceled after the first season or two, which in my opinion are under rated series like banshee or... are really 10 times better than this over rated seriesThank you for taking the time to read this text.
9	11 October 2021	joshuahoare-53718	Painfully relevant and meaningful	On the base, Squid Game appears to be a standard Korean horror/thriller we have been slowly getting more accustomed to in the west over the past few years, however beneath the surface is a very deep, complex and scarily real message that is incredibly relevent in these troubling times.Without spoiling anything, this series is certainly worth sticking with through the slower parts, as the ending and message is extremely powerful. Worryingly, I feel the complexity of the message may mean it is lost on the average viewer, but left me deep in though and reflection upon its completion.I'm sure in the years to come this series will be looked back on as the benchmark for complex and contrasted story telling, and even though it is extremely popular now, in years to come it's message may be more appreciated.
10	11 October 2021	mahdihero-27983	Best dram	Plz make chapter 2.I like it.can top 1 in worldBestBest.
9	11 October 2021	mangeshramoshi	Twist of player 001 is unexpectable...	Red light, green light is horrible and Little bit commedy scene show in instagram. Show I decide to watch this series. Sugar honeycomb is I like between all games. Upto 5 th episode everything is going well and enjoying but at 6th episode my heart goes down at that time. All liked players get eliminated. After watched 6th episode all further episode got silence. Twist of player 001 is unexpectable. I like background sounds of games. End is good like I thinking.
10	11 October 2021	prashantsinghantiphishing	Life is game	Awesome series. Episode 6 my favorite 😘Starting to end superb bond.
7	11 October 2021	millicenttoney	Add more actors	You need to add player 324 as he has an important role.
2	11 October 2021	pahlito	Depressing and predictable	This show started of interesting but in the end it was a let down. The characters became annoying and predictable and the story left too many questions unanswered. There is a difference between leaving the viewer wanting to know more and simply leaving too many blanks, in my opinion Squid Game did the latter.At the end, you've spent the entire season watching a miserable guy get kidnapped, beaten, everyone close to him killed and at the very end he leaves his child hanging once again. If this was a build up to a second season, I really don't care. I regret buying into the hype of watching this.
8	11 October 2021	samsinger-63455	Something Missing	Episodes 1-6 were addictive, intense, original, clever and shocking. Genuinely incredible TV.Episodes 7-9 had some good twists but overall empty and missing that something special.
10	11 October 2021	mariamzaitoon	It's full of excitement and enthusiasm, I loved it so much	It's full of excitement and enthusiasm, I loved it so much.
4	12 October 2021	cordlessphone	Great Filmmaking, Bad Storytelling	This is a horror story, and I'm not normally a huge fan of the genre, which could make my read on it a bit uncharitable. However, it seems to present itself early on as more than just a horror story, which in my opinion it ultimately is not.Most of the plot outside of the titular games ends up culminating in a couple of twists that somehow both are predictable and make little to no sense in the context of the rest of the story.There is a lot to like here - stunning visuals, an eerie soundtrack, and plenty of solid performances in the early going. If you're in it for the survival horror of it all, this might be an entertaining thrill ride, and that's okay. For me, outside of a few well-delivered character moments early on, it played as a sloppily constructed piece of visual storytelling which spends most of its runtime on overlong, ultra violent, empty spectacle.
1	12 October 2021	mqsgyvmy	Horrible show	Don't waste your time on this one. Whoever created this must have a very evil twisted minded.
10	12 October 2021	maxnodejson	This is a Pure Evil Masterpiece.	This is a pure evil masterpiece to look inside of real human nature.Especially, it was very good social experiment in the episode 6.
5	12 October 2021	ankitparsai	Not Unique	Lot of movies/series are better than this one, can't write the movie/series name here which are way better then this as it will consider as spoiler, but honestly there is nothing like spoiler in this series.Lengthy unnecessarily.Well promoted by Netflix and team to get much more attention of viewers.
10	12 October 2021	bsahtekhbib	Awesome	Amaziiiiing. Séries, the cast , the end , the games , the captain really it is the best series I have watched this year. Really thanks to netflix for this amazing series, I hope another season is coming soon , Thank youuuu.
2	12 October 2021	devaratitripathi	A bad copy of Alice in Borderland	I was honestly excited when I started the series, primarily because it was blowing up on social media. It did sound similar to Alice in Borderland (which had turned out be one my favourite series of all time), but I wanted to find out why it took off in the first place, when Alice in Borderland didn't receive nearly as much attention.Up until the tug-of-war episode, it seemed to be going okay. I think, for me, it peaked at the tug-of-war episode. But after that the whole series turned into a snooze fest. I mean, oh my god, it turned out to be so mind numbingly boring. And some areas were so blatantly copied from Alice in Borderland that I was shocked this series did not get slapped with a copyright. Ugh, such a waste of time. Honestly, if you've seen Alice in Borderland, don't bother watching Squid Game. The comparison is inevitable and it will leave behind a bitter taste.
7	12 October 2021	villhxrry	ok	Its a good series and I enjoyed it but the V. I. P s kinda ruins it. That's why I give it a 7, it was a really good series so I feel like they could have added something else then the V. I. P s.
9	13 October 2021	FarrukhAhmedCPA	Thoroughly enjoyed	Haven't enjoyed a series like this in a while. It's different and gets you instantly looked. The design and detail in the show is incredible, can't wait for season 2.
1	13 October 2021	birgit-82271	Disturbing	Very violent and disturbing series. I hoped I would understand the hype after pushing through to the end but also the ending is disappointing. You will watch desperate people doing anything for money, showing that you cannot trust anyone and at the end there's only 1 winner who won't change his life after being rich.
7	13 October 2021	enigmafantasy	Grazing the majesty	It's obvious that the idea of the games involving the lives of humans has appeared more than once in TV shows. Although the director has confirmed that the idea was planned many years ago, it's questionable that originality is one of its strengths. However, this series has made a different approach to the category, and for that reason I can understand its impact.The mixture of show and survival makes this story special. Involving emotions in tragic games transforms fear into treason, empathy into selfishness and hate into pain. Something that is usually complex to achieve. Social context plays an essential role in the series. Knowing the personal situations of the participants creates a vital link between the game and society. Best aspects? Feelings. Everything that this series could make you feel has a purpose and a reason. Almost every action of the characters is explainable in a certain way but also leaves you room for doubts and predictions about the next move. You won't get bored with the episodes, which is a priority among thrillers.Drawbacks? As I see it, the games ended faster than I was expecting. When you are risking your life, time seems to pass really slowly and in the series it happened all the opposite. For instance, I would have tried to enlarge the game scenes in the episodes. It's true that with this improvement your are risking the total timing, and perhaps it could become tiring, but that would be the best idea to take advantage of such a great plot. It would also have given the chance to extend a bit on the story of some characters that are relevant in the development of the series, which could be seen as one of the negative aspects, the lack of depth.All in all, it's such an excellent production, and I strongly recommend it without doubts.
6	17 October 2021	hendriksass	Overrated	It's not shockingly bad but nonetheless one of the worst thrillers I've ever seen. Not challenging and thrilling at all. The series tries to appear twisted with a playful scenery and costumes, which from the beginning just comes across as cheap, interchangeable and unoriginal. The plot rarely managed to build up emotions and tension - with the exception of episode 6. At some points, especially during the last few episodes, it seemed like they were trying really hard to make up as many "unpredictable" moments as possible. Which didn't work out well. One positive thing is the acting, which was very enjoyable consistently throughout the series.In summary, an overrated series with a poor storyline, a below average set design and good actors.
6	14 October 2021	cyn0sur3	Could be cool, but...	The concept and idea of the game is pretty cool, but there are too many holes in the plot to be able to enjoy it as much as I should.Why did the old man vote to end it after the first game, when he was behind it all?Where did all the prize money and money to keep staff and facilities etc come from? Did the VIP's really sponsor with this amount of cash?Who are these people working there accepting all of this?How can these competitions have lasted for over a decade without any of them getting the story out?How could the organ harvester do this, with the trap doors in special furnaces etc. Without it being known by the front man?The idea of deathly competitions with child games are quite thought out and brilliant, except that there are games that really are not child games.However when trying to create the reason and background for all of it, it just feels flat and like a quick fix.The VIP's acting/script is just as horrible and flat as the story behind it all.I can still recommend people to watch it though!It still is quite exciting at times and the relationships are pretty well thought out!
9	14 October 2021	80sMovieLoverLV426	Overrated yet compelling	I love this show and binged it in 2 days just to find everyone on TikTok getting views on it from cringe videos. The show itself was amazing and is a much watch but avoid TikTok.
9	14 October 2021	mbeals-99183	Not the ending I would have expected	I thought the only person who did not cheat would be the one who would win.But you kind of knew who it would be based on the focus on the one character but still! Also, I thought one of the gamblers could have been a previous winner, but maybe that's too easy?Still a good show, hoping the 2nd season just as good.
8	14 October 2021	romanshablio	Hate the main character	I finished. And San Ghi Khun is annoying me. He annoyed me in the start of show and in the end. He won, yes he lost a lot of dearest people, but anyway he has his daughter and like always he didn't choose his family and maybe last person who loves him. He go around and went on a game. For the revenge idk or for something else. But i think he did wrong choice.
10	15 October 2021	leoguigue	I LOVE THIS SERIES	My favourite series is squid game . This is a drama, Thriller,action Serie . It's a South Korean created and directed by Hwang dong Hyun .

It's the only series I watched in my life and I love it.
2	15 October 2021	maryhr-79231	Overrated and predictable	I had been waiting for a month to watch this series with my partner together, I was very excited. Until last night we saw it and I am very disappointed 😐all the praises for this? Rotten 91? Really ?overrated. In my opinion, many people who had a positive opinion did not see movies and series like this. Of course, doing copying doesn't matter at all, if the execution is good. You know what I mean? You can copy but if you have a good performance why not, you can be the best. Unlike this series. :/1- In the first episode, I guessed the end of the series. I predicted everything, even the dialogues. See how cliché a series must be that I can predict so fast and not even a single one was wrong!2- The first episodes, when they got the policeman involved in the story, I liked it very much and I thought to myself that it was going to be interesting. But that didn't happen, the policeman struggles were not shown and there was not even any stress, and he was like Hitman! Or like an American spy Hollywood movie with an Indian theme ! Which had minor bugs.3- The first few episodes were very important for the backstory and story settings, but in these episodes, emotions were expressed in a dull way; Also, again, in a clichéd way, the characterization was mixed with melodrama if it could have been done more delicately, it would be great.And None of the characters grow up, the cliche bad and good always.4- there were not any backstory in some scenes where it must have a back story. There were Scenes where it could be symbolized, but no attention was paid to it. There were contradictions in some scenes and even in the story. Some flashback's timing were wrong and leaked the story further. The soundtrack was not good.5. The VIP section was awful; Apart from the bad acting, their voices and accents was awful and their script and dialogue were the worst part of the series.6. There are much better movies, series, mangas and even video games with this concept, maybe sometimes more creative and well-made. When you copy this concept, you have to present something different to be the best, unlike this series.The positive points if I want to say:1- they voluntarily had to choose to return to the game, it was a new thing and I liked it.2- great acting (except VIP)Now let me tell you the list:-battle royale 2000Most subsequent films and series were inspired by this.-3 percent.Most importantly, the same 3% (3%) series that Ive watched four years ago, and I certainly say that everyone should have seen this first.-Alice in Borderlandhunger gamescube 1997-Kaiji series-king's game,-would you rather,As the Gods Will,which also played the game green and red lights.-Escape room-Saw ,-Movie circle,the belko experiment,-Future Diary animeAnd battle game in 5 second (average)liar gameAnd other movies, series and manga.
10	15 October 2021	saralucassl	Really god	It's a really deep message mixed with horror. I really loved it but it's tough to watch because it's so violent. If you're really empathetic it will mess with you. I think it's worth it tho, the message it's really important. I think it's a 10/10. Hope there's a second season. The actors are really good too, and the direction and effects.
8	15 October 2021	tydyclothing	Good Plot, Very Addicted, Slightly Confused	So I loved it, got very addicted to it and watched it in 2 days (could of done it in a day but I'm a working adult). I was very much into it through it all until the 5th game and onwards... the 5th game was just a bit of a mess and we all knew who was going to end up getting through. Then the last 2 episodes turned into quite a confusion when 2 of the leads die and then the main characters goes off into the world with obvious PTSD and a huge bank account. Rewind a year and he goes to meet the old man who is still alive (no shock there) and then he dies... cool story. Then he has some sort of middle aged mental breakdown, dyes his hair red, managed to break the girls brother out of a kids home and adopt him to the other guys mum and then finds out squid game is still going and goes all dolally. All in all... is there a season 2?
5	15 October 2021	ilonayux	Bingeable, but extremely overhyped and definitely not amazing	Watched the show in 2 days, i must admit, it is in fact quite bingeable. However, I'm confused as to what i saw versus the reception by the audience, as "the most amazing and smart netflix-show ever created". Did we watch the same show?Overall, the show is decent. It's not original, which it is (hopefully) not trying to be, the execution is solid (for the most part). Some of the games were pretty interesting, s.a. The dalgona candy game or the squid game.However, the show lacks a lot of development, considering for how long its is, and has major plot problems: the storyline about dissection of the organs suddenly discontinued, i thought that was the whole point of these games? To gather a lot of bodies in order to dissect them and sell the organs. Nope, apparently not. Apparently, it's because some old man was bored on his death bead. In fact, nothing in the show was really explained, everyone's motivation seemed unclear and illogical in regard to what they were actually doing. I couldn't care for any of the characters, couldn't care for their death or their life or dynamic, couldn't care for the story of the two brothers, couldn't care for their interactions because they were all super super shallow.Conversations were super awkward, boring, dragged on for too long paired with a lot of severe and uncomfortable overacting by the actors. Tried to be extremely melodramatic in parts where it wasn't called for.Many other details didn't make sense or were just super unrealistic.The vips took the whole cake and ruined the show for good, but then the ending itself managed to suck even more.Well...i would definitely cut this show some slack, if it wasn't so well recieved. Come on guys, it's an okay show but definitely not the best Netflix show ever. People are calling it genius for foreshadowing the character's death when i could tell you 10 other shows that did it in the same way, as it is a common storytelling technique (and not original at that)I'm starting to think, people are pushing this show just because it is a Korean production, trying to make it out to be the best movie industry.Anyways, don't expect too much from this show, it's definitely overhyped and I'm glad i watched it early on, when it wasn't too popular yet.
10	16 October 2021	patelabhay-40171	Just Amazing	It was truly are very good movie I like that you must also go and see it very very funny and very very dramatic.It contains several thrilling dramatic and Furious scenes across the full series it was just in amazing experience to watch this movie.
4	18 October 2021	singleway	not all good	The advantages are all over. Let me talk about the most disgusting thing. Just like the director's former work which is "Silenced", the screen is full of sensationalism.
7	17 October 2021	juanpablobourget	Great series, lame ending	The series had my attention gripped tight from episodes 1 - 7. If I would have stopped right there I would have given it a 9/10, but then episodes 8 and 9 happen.I findd Gi-Hun being mad at Sang-Woo for sacrificing the glasses guy just a dumb way to create conflict between the characters. Gi-Hun betrays his friend because he saved his life??? Gi-Hun just doesn't work as a main character, at the very end he barely grows as a character. Imagine how great it would have been if Sang-Woo had won the squid game and then have to live with the fact that he killed his friend, it would have made for a very dark yet introspective finale.I have mixed feelings towards the old man being the host of the games, it kinda ruins the Gganbu scene, but at the same time I like how deranged and twisted was his justification for starting the games.Gi-Hun leaving the airport to stop the games instead of visiting his daughter is kinda lame. It just felt like a cheap sequel-bait ending. Season 2 will likely be the typical "small resistance group trying to take down the opressors", and I'm tired of stories taking the same turn over and over again.I get that I'm complaining just because thigs didn't end the way I wanted, but don't you think it would have been more interesting if we had gotten a darker and conclusive ending rather than the one we got, which I think is kinda generic?
9	17 October 2021	saabirchaudhry	Great Show	After a long time i enjoy such a type of great show really good tv series 9/10. I hooked up to this tv series till the end really a great show like game of thrones.
7	18 October 2021	sathvikvanaparthy	Watchable	Apart from other reviews, this webseries is good and we can watch it for once. They could've made it better.Because one may feel lag at some scenes while watching and the games that they play are a bit interesting. You can enjoy this once But don't keep your expectations high coz eveybody dont feel the same.Few cons apart YOU CAN GO FOR IT.
1	18 October 2021	jojolapompa	Don't waste your time watching it	Squid Game is the single worst tv show that I have ever watched. From the script to the direction, to the framing : everything is hideous. Really disappointed I wasted some time of my life watching it.PS : thanks for destroying Le Beau Danube Bleu.
7	19 September 2021	hollywoodchad7	As the Gods will ...again?	This felt like yet another Korean remake of a popular Japanese TV show and/or movie (which itself was originally a manga) -- The movie in question is, "As The Gods Will" which came out in Japan back in 2014. Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends.
7	28 September 2021	angelretch	Disturbing and bizarre	Definitely gives viewers a good look at what people who are struggling financially with major problems are willing to do for money as well as what people with too much money are willing to do for entertainment. Planned on writing how absolutely nauseating the VIP's were in their acting abilities but SO many people beat me to it. Seriously the dialogue was so awful I was actually getting irritated whenever they were on screen and the delivery would have sounded more human if it had been robotic voices. They manage to grate on your nerves while completely taking you out of the story.
6	29 September 2021	wid390	Brilliant until the last half hour	Another series were it keeps you on your toes, but then the ending has you scratching your head. Why?????
2	7 October 2021	peter-horrey	Squirm game-just awf	Just awful. How on Earth can anyone rate this as even close to Westworld. If Squid game is a 9 then. Westworld is a 90! This is the Kings suit of clothing. I loved Parasite, it was utterly brilliant. This is embarrassing and very poor. The acting, the script, the subtitles are all of a student making their first feature. Netflix launched with Game of Cards and have followed up with countless classics (Dark is a breathtaking series), Sex Education is so entertaining. And the list goes on until we hit the buffers with Squid Game. I hate to be negative as 99% of my reviews on here are extremely positive. There is plenty more fish on Netflix leave this little sea creature in the depths of dystopian bilge.
2	12 October 2021	YazdanKM	A bad serries but not that bad for being just entertained	1. Too many plot holes2. No character development3. Might be visually entertaining4. A potentially good stroy5. An absolutely weak scenario6. Mediocre acting7. Predictable8. One of the worst endings ever9. Too cliché10. Mostly too rediculous.
1	7 October 2021	minimal-minds	Boring AF	Slow developing and boring story, boring actors that over-react. Squid Game is just over-hyped. Would not recommend wasting your time.
7	12 October 2021	bebel2305	Cool Korean Hunger Games	It was very good and thrilling at the beginning, but on episode 6 I noticed how long the dialogues and things were taking and I actually fell asleep because it was tedious. For some reason I didn't even get emotional on that episode, just felt like some things didn't even make sense.From that on, I was more interested on the police officer's plot than actually the games. And this is another thing that didn't even get closure. If you're not certain there'll be another season, you can't just let things unfinished.The ending didn't get me and somethings didn't make sense (like that hair?). It was obvious his mother would be dead by the time he got home, I knew it since episode 2.There are some CLEAR nods (maybe even copy?) to The Hunger Games movies, such as the song that is played to the characters (even though it's a classic song, it was very clearly copying the Panem Anthem idea), the score soundtrack of the series while the game is going on (very similar to the movies), even some camera shots and the VIPS watching the games and betting on players. Even the ending was similar, only it wasn't a Peeta the second contestant.It was an ok show, it would be more fun to watch if the dialogues were more direct and things happened faster.
3	12 October 2021	gg_nefeli	Seriously??	I like the series but feel so disappointed with the ending. He earned so much money and instead of helping his family and daughter, he wants to become Batman and save the world. I am super disappointed.
2	8 October 2021	ciudnesnis	Lame	Acting 3/10. Story 1/10. Visuals 6/10. Feels like a B rated holywood movie from the 80s. Is it reddit or 4chan behind the hype again?
8	22 September 2021	lawumun	Wow...totally binged this one!	If you can get past the dubbing, this is a brilliant nail biter...unlike anything I have seen before...I would HIGHLY recommend.
4	2 October 2021	da-pena	Overatted, predictable, stereotyped	It's watchable but i really don't get from where it got so much good reviews... The concept is nothing new, totally predictable, overloaded with all stereotypes... VERY AVERAGE SERIES. That's it!I can only imagine people having discussions about it and extrapolate to human behaviors, what they would do in same situation or full with theories on how money controls our lives etc pfffffffff... boring!!!I watched it but with my finger constantly on the +10 sec...
6	2 October 2021	singha-sommer	Entertaining but lacks good games	Watch Anime like Kaiji or Gambling Emperor Zero and you find way smartes mindgames. Those squid games are just cheap and easy with no real solution behind it.Just a ripoff.
4	18 October 2021	trigono2	Please watch Alice in Borderland instead.	This show was pretty cool in terms of the players and the games, but that only accounted for maybe 30% of the show in its entirety. I absolutely could not have cared less about all the behind the scenes storylines.
10	1 October 2021	Seropdiablo204	Excellent	Couldn't think of a better show, I didn't sleep once through the whole thing, didn't even leave my seat!!!
10	10 October 2021	lochnessprod	Cast list??	Why is this cast list so effed up? Second billing Gi-hun is NOT Gi-hun and that for sure is not Ali.
10	28 September 2021	lauroo-193-217272	For fans of...	Parasite, Saw, Hunter X Hunter, Cube, Black Mirror, The Platform, Oldboy... Takeshi's Castle?An unexpected mix of all my favourite things - Squid Game is the best thing I've watched this year.An intriguing premise that actually delivers. I went in with no expectations and was blown away!
10	26 September 2021	angela-harris-232-3717	Best lipsync I've ever seen	I loved it. Right up to the vips, which were pathetic, however didn't ruin the show too much.Well worth the binge on a Saturday night.
9	28 September 2021	caosshow	What a surprise	This show is a masterpiece, very deep in many aspects, the only negative aspect are the VIP's.
10	9 October 2021	sober118	Top Class Show	One of the very few TV series which I watched in one go. Fantastic concept, great acting and superb screen play makes it one of the classic TV show of all times.
5	6 October 2021	arslanmanzoor123	Don't waste your time watching this.	This was a really predictable and another boring way of showing evil of greed and what things people can do for money. Unnecessary suspense. Wasted my time watching this.
5	22 September 2021	starikovia	Good idea, but sooooo slow and predicatable	You get into in at first but then it gets very slow, too many conversations, and it moves so slow you get tired of watching. Fast forwarded half of season. Could've been much better.
9	3 October 2021	clausbe	Great show VIP cast straight from The Room	Really great show. Loved it but found it strange like so many others that the VIP actors are so horrible bad in delivering their lines. It's almost if Tommy Wiseau and the cast from The Room hid behind the VIP masks. Anyway I can live with the bad acting in that episode because everything else is just fantastic.
5	18 October 2021	vogt1977	The running man and The long walk in one deeir	If I had not read the 2 books from the 1960' and 1970' by Stephen King, I would have watched the serie with different eyes.But I have read both novels. . So, it's a good serie, that shows what people are willing to do for money. If their life sucks. It shows how the rich people take advantage of the misery of the poor.
1	18 October 2021	joaovictorop-462-879897	Another Christophobic series from Netflix	It is terrifying how cristophobia (attacks on the Christian faith and on Christians) is one of the main banners of the New Left in the world and of a large part of the media that promote these ideologies. This series makes several subtle attacks on Christians, trying to promote hatred and anger against followers of the Christian faith. One of the Christian characters is a hypocritical speaker, prays to try to cover the crimes he commits, and the series shows several negative characteristics of this character as if they were common to all Christians. In another situation, a character's father is a practicing Christian but beats his wife every day and then prays, until one day he kills the woman. There are several subtle attacks on the Christian faith, always in a derogatory and hateful view.
6	13 October 2021	kolaolsi	I really don't understand why people have gone crazy with this!	This series is just another average one. Nothing less nothing more!And I am explaining:1) NOT original at all. Several movies had as the main idea a game of life and death. Also a recent Japanese series (Alice in borderland) has almost the exact same idea.2) totally predictable even for a six years old.3) Overdramatic without any reason using of course too much of the respective music.4) The acting was almost ridiculous and almost making you laugh instead of feeling what the creator thought you should feel.AND PEOPLE for god sake don't fall for marketing tricks, promotions and trendy stuff.There are so many more (countless) shows and series way much better than this that deserve your time. STOP being sheep and just doing something just because is viral.And i am saying all these after i have watched about 200-300 TV shows and Series and countless movies and not only that trendy ones!Thank you for your attention.(Sorry for my possibly bad English)
9	7 October 2021	k-a-thompson-464-10299	Intense show.	Everything about this was great except for the VIPs. The writing and acting is so atrocious. We could have have done with them speaking at all.
8	26 September 2021	fuzznag	All players chose to play on their own...	What about the first 200+ casualities on the first game who didn't know they were going to die if they participate? I think the old man was kind of an ass and wasn't really a chaotic neutral character they tried to portray him to be at the end.Overall, good show.
9	28 September 2021	richardhaaijer	Perfect in every way except for the vips.	This serie was mindblowing but the vips actwork was so terrible i cant give it a 10. Thankfully vips were not a major part of the serie.
7	13 October 2021	makaykay928	VIPs gotta go	The show is great with strong acting from everyone except the VIPs. Gosh!... I don't know if the english actors they get are wannabe actors who live in Korea or what but for all the Korean dramas I've seen the english actors are the worst. The Pakistani actor was top notch. Give him a few more roles in Korea please. The emotion was right there and his limited Korean was realistic for the role.
1	9 October 2021	Mina-zaharinova	Boring and Predictable	I give 1 star for the idea. The rest is media hype. Very superficial and easily predictable. You can spend your time better.
5	12 October 2021	s-rabe1987	The definition of "overhyped"	This series is by no means a "must watch". All characters except for the main protagonist fall flat. I must say that the acting of Hoyen Jung is not good. All she does is staring grimly into the void.Up until the third game, the series was interesting to watch, if you like the survival/battle royal genre. However, don't expect any unpredictable events. Everything after that just felt trashy with artificial emotions. Even the story around the games, with the cop and the frontman could have been sooo much deeper. Why did the winner of the 2015 games become the frontman? Why was there a bomb introduced? How did the organ trafficking have any impact on the story? Why did noone notice the murals in the sleeping room showed all the games? The list goes on...The worst thing by far was the cringeworthy acting by the VIPs. I have to say, it is actually an achievement to be acting so bad, even though you wear a mask and all you have to do is sit on a couch. I mean, a sixty-nine joke, really? Come on.Any theorycrafting which is done now is because of the bad writing. I can totally understand why the script was rejected before so many times.
6	19 September 2021	tranhienthuong0901	It is way under my expectation	I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible.
7	1 October 2021	mazoona_911	ZzZ	I liked it , but it was boring sometimes and the actores whose spoke English was badIt should be more suspense.
10	24 September 2021	gunghocjp	Extremely depicted on the corrupted desire of capital	Squid game is a conventional drama which is dipicted on living experience of human being addicted to capitality. The various games in the drama is showing a testimony that people are living for.People.
8	28 September 2021	alicevictoriahallam	Excellent drama, binge worthy!	+ brilliant storyline, keeps you gripped until the end+ great acting from the main actors+ dubbed in English was fine and easy to follow, subtitles well done too+ really got attached to the characters, got a bit emotional in parts!left me with a lot of questions at the end of the seriesfound the ending a little frustrating, maybe I didn't understand it?!
7	30 September 2021	supersmellyscallywag	Main Character Ruins the Show	Good writing, poor message. Some notable plot holes but nothing ruins it more than a main character who signs up for the games, sees death, is allowed to leave and then comes back to play only to blame other people for the fates of the fallen players. The show makes the people who understand what the games are out to be villains. And of course the foolish, self righteous, hypocrite wins it all.
10	26 September 2021	mikimcsween	Made me cry	If you are looking for a show with amazing performers (except the vip) then you need to watch squid game. Episode 6 is heart breaking. A tv show has yet to make me cry yet this one did. If I could give another standing ovation then I would.
9	22 September 2021	pbhargesh82	My first korean drama and damn it's good as hell.	You love characters who are good and you actually hate those who are bad. It's that good. Ignore the VIP!!!!
8	26 September 2021	cccsmn	Great binge-watching	Curiosity got me and I started watching it. I found it thoughtful, it gave me another perspective of nowadays society. It's absolutely worth watching it, better than many other series now on Netflix. If you watched "The Platform" (Netflix), you will find it amazing for you.
1	7 October 2021	panalma-751-631841	Why?	Didn't we already have hunger games?!? Why do so many dramas have to be filled with violence, yes, that may reflect what's going on in the outside world and that again it is a male dominated series -so I guess another one for the guys and girls who like to look at those guys.
10	28 September 2021	grimlen09	I got hooked	Nice Korean TV show intense, funny and likeable characters.
8	5 October 2021	hieiknight_834	It's good show but the English subtitle kinda ruin it for some people	It's a very good show. The first 6 episodes are the best then it went downhill after that. The English subtitle and the English dub do not match at all. It's better to have English dub without subtitle. Or it is way better to just watch it with the original language with English sub.
9	15 October 2021	azakrezisrac	mindblowing	This is a well written story. I'm not english and not even korean but the english voice acting is killing me. It's a pain. In my country voice acting is a serious business but this is the cheapest thing i've ever heard. Even the lines are simplified too much.
10	10 October 2021	masoodnz42	Awesome series	The show wasreally nice and did not expect the vilan and last episode was unexpectedly awesome.
9	26 September 2021	baobaz	The movie that make me curious	I watched the movie because I heard from my friend this movie was good. When I watched this movie for the first time, I really liked the story line. It makes me curious. I watched episode 1 - 9 in one night.
4	3 October 2021	ivanpk85-894-844225	I dont get it	I dont understand hype abot this. Pretty average show. Only thing fun are the games, and that is 10% of the show.
9	29 September 2021	razaxo	One of the best original shows to come out!!	From the start to finish, the show is an emotional roller coaster. Full of mystery and suspense. Only downside I'd say is that, due to nature of the show, we had an idea who would win. All main characters were quickly realised and we had a expectation that who'd make it. Not as suspenseful as perhaps Game of thrones. I mean I know its only 9 part show and the show runner had no idea where it would go.It's a crime that it's been sitting on shelf for 12 years before someone gave it a GREEN LIGHT. I mean we could have been on season 12 or perhaps it would have ended by now.I personally can't wait for season 2.
1	4 October 2021	Besso6767	Everything is predictable	The dialogue is poor. I knew who will die and who will win. It's really an overrated series I recommend to watch D. P it's much better.
9	28 September 2021	nobal813	Madness but real	In our present day there is reality shows like survivor looks like the squid game but not killing but I'm surr soon we will see the real squid game in our live.The serie is very good and attractive. I like it.
1	13 October 2021	leo-vandebre	I don't understand the hype	The show is so bland! I don't even know where to start. The acting is bad, and the characters do not make sense at the time. There is no depth whatsoever, there is nothing between the lines and the story doesn't add up. I really hope the rating would fall below 7/10 since this doesn't make any sense.
9	29 September 2021	killer_dudi	Awesome show	Awesome show couldn't stop watching it. The way everyone gets scared loves the lady and the gangster always arguing. Sad part when the marbles were replaced with stones.
10	5 October 2021	sarah21897	What a show! I cannot fault it.	I am absolutely blown away by this show - thankfully not in the red light, green light sense. I wish I could wipe it from my mind just to experience it all over again.The writing is impeccable from start to finish, the characters, the pace, the TENSION that the writers create make for a rollercoaster viewing. I screamed, I cried, I cringed, I covered my face but still watched through my hands because honestly you can not look away while watching this show. It is so clever yet so simplistic in it's storytelling. You will adore some characters and sympathise with some of the darker characters once you learn more about them.I cannot fault it. Even the VIPs that everyone is talking about did not take away from the action for me. They were vile but the stakes in the episode are so high you won't really care.Honestly I haven't been this enthralled and excited about a show since I was a teenager going to watch Catching Fire in the cinema.If gory things aren't your cup of tea then be warned, but I wouldn't miss out on this show because of that.
8	28 September 2021	kramer5540	Maybe don't watch it in public	It's the twist no one wanted. But I still thought it was a very interesting season. I watched most of it on planes and would not recommend that, I felt bad for the passengers all around me.
10	19 September 2021	hoobastank6889	Really, it is this good	My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.
7	13 October 2021	mo_7eb	A script for dummies...	This was a disappointment, coming with high hopes from all the buzz about it and previous experience with Korean drama with greats like Parasite...The ideas are great and promising, yet the bad script brought it really down, the script describes everything and doesn't really leave room for you to figure it out on your own; as well as being full of badly written cliches. I don't mind a cliche but at least make an effort to not make it seem like one.The newly introduced characters in episode 7 were the most atrocious addition, their acting and lines were beyond horrible that I thought I was watching a high school production.An overall meh...
9	21 September 2021	crimescene-x	Fantastic all together but..	The VIP's were, as many said before, horrible actors.
8	6 October 2021	FotBok	Worth you time.	Don't know if there will be a second season. The end for the first one does not have the same value as the rest of the series.
6	15 October 2021	lousammy0	Ehh.	Acting very hit or miss. Ending kinda wack. Vip scenes were extremely cringey and poorly done. Plot holes here and there. Things that are really unbelievable like 2 people getting away with using a lighter in the honeycomb game.
9	30 September 2021	qusaiaamer	I miss this creativity	All the tv makers should benchmark their creativity with this. We are hungry for new out of the box script with good acting.
9	1 October 2021	morgan-byrge	Haven't been this hooked in a while	This series hooked me in fast. My husband and I binged the series in two days. It showed the dark side of human desperation all while somehow being relatable regardless of your status in this world. Everyone makes it a point to mention the VIP's, which yes the acting was poor, but it didn't tarnish the rest of the show. I won't say too much more other than the fact I'm pissed I cried the way I did over that old man lmao bamboozled.
10	29 September 2021	ehsan-karimidorabi	Aesome	Awesome and I like you. Best Series I have been right now.
1	7 October 2021	eserdemiroz	Terrible	Terrible acting, terrible scenario. I couldn't finish the first episode. Simply waste of money and time.
10	27 September 2021	ahmadfilth666	Great plot	Simply i enjoyed every single minute in the magnificent series.
6	12 October 2021	kirsten-kairuz	Entertaining but don't understand the hype	So there's no denying that this is an entertaining show but come on people - what's all this hype about?!? The storyline itself is fairly unoriginal - although different...there are other movies based on a similar story (people playing a game against each other, resulting in death, secret societies, delving into humanities primal response to self-preservation etc.) and for the most part I found it totally predictable! Again - don't get me wrong...I enjoyed it - it was easy watching and a pleasant enough weekend binge but I genuinely do not understand the hype...there are far greater shows that deserve more credit than this. So in conclusion - watch it for yourself...but don't expect it to be mind-blowing.P.s. The dubbing is awful - please watch it in Korean with subtitles...much, much better!
6	12 October 2021	squiffynole	Left with an Empty Feeling	I confess to watching every episode before realizing the characters were an overused, worn-out personality mix, the plot was predictable and the hundreds of assassination style killings were the central plot driver.But still part me enjoyed the novelty, the exposure of human fragilities and the bright color sets and costuming.The product is not that great, the remarkable popularity might be explained by the economic desperation many of us feel right now and perhaps it taps into a growing resentment toward the financial elite.
8	4 October 2021	vansh-kathuria5000	It got me awestruck for a moment but it got sunk in the plotholes.	Loved the first few episodes. I slept late on a working night just to watch it in a single go.The plotholes though were definitely trying to sink this Titanic in the end.1. The Cop story -I can't digest that he could so easily swoop the whole facility and got caught on a distant island instead.The morse code thing, what was is about?He had sent proofs about the games to the police via his super long-lasting iphone but still nobody does anything for an year?So basically his character development goes in vain. Gets killed by his own brother and couldn't do anything about the game.2. At the end, the three finalists had been given one knife each. What if 2 people would have got killed? If yes, there would have been a winner without even playing the last game. What's the point of such scheduling, planning and discipline. It doesn't make sense.3. The glass shattering scene at the end of the game was totally unnecessary and senseless. What if they killed all their participants unknowingly? There would be no games at all, no winner?4. VIPs were totally unnecessary. They didn't even show their betting properly. After all, at the end it turns it was all for fun but we never saw that enthusiastic gambling from the vips.There are more but I guess I can remember this much only as of now.
1	14 October 2021	deanbaxter79	Terribly Predictable	Thank god for the 15 second skip button, I found this show utterly predictable, the over acting is atrocious, I love Asian Kung fu films this is just terrible acting, the only part I didn't pick was 001, I'll never watch another Korean film again.
7	9 October 2021	andres-cumsille	Nice show, but not entirely beliavable	The show was OK, but the storyline about the detective was just too much. I mean, He just happened to be passing by when the main character was reporting the games to the police. He was JUST following the main character the day he returned to the games. He curiously had a disappeared brother that won a few games before this one. He should have been caught like a thousand times for being sloppy. And finally the brother being the leader was just ridiculous.
9	4 October 2021	sheko3506	Great korean show 👍	One of the best korean show i had ever seen,i hope there' second season of it , love it..
10	18 October 2021	purptoup	Edge of your seat	Real suspense thriller. Great show. Exciting from start to finish. An international hit. Perhaps a season 2 ??? Would be awesome. South Korea has produced a tremendous television show.
10	11 October 2021	yanalom21	This is a fantastic show!	This show was truly one-of-a-kind. I adore everything about it. One of my current favourite series, and I'm looking forward to the second season.
9	7 October 2021	stargazerpjs	A surprisingly good horror story	My kids on my back to watch it, so watched first episode, bit over the top for me and didn't think much of the first episode, but then watched the second and I got hooked, watched the whole series, this not perfect but bloody close, it got me in and I enjoyed the first season allot so much I'm watching it again. I can see why it is so popular and now I have to wait for second season. Really worth watching but warning allot of blood and gore.
8	2 October 2021	renta-ghost	Could have been perfect.	Loads of reviews detailing the series so won't bother going in to that. What Netflix needs to do is to get the director to re-edit the series. Remove the VIPs, the doctor, organ trafficking and missing police brother storyline. Keep it really tight on the games and the contenders. Reduce it to just 5 or 6 episodes. Call it Squid Game: Redux or something. Would be perfect.
10	4 October 2021	chuckyswife	MASTERPIECE	But the VIPs were CRINGE!Great acting, great story, great twists!
10	6 October 2021	adam-hills-01476	Fantastic - watch it in Korean as well	I really really enjoyed this. The acting from the Korean actors was incredible, all of them were brilliant and so believable. All the interactions between the players in the early games were so great, especially Gi-Hun, Ming-Wae and Sang-Woo. Yes the English actors were crap but it didn't really detract from it, if anything it made them more creepy and added to the atmosphere that they saw themselves as Gods.Don't want to spoil it but honestly it's so worth a watch. As awful as it is, it highlights the terrible things that possibly happen in the world.
9	1 October 2021	kliti	Great show, but...	This is everything you want from a TV-Series. Drama, Thriller, Entertainment, good acting for a TV series and of course very good storyline.The Koreans never seem to disappoint when it comes to Drama/Thrillers. There's always something you don't expect that happens at some time in the movie/series that you just are left speechless.If Wes Anderson would have made a Thriller Tv Series, I think it would've pretty much looked like this one, haha. I liked the cameras, the scenes where it looks like an animation movie (e.g. The stairs), and most of all the symmetry.The actors who play the VIPs are extremely bad at acting. I mean, what the hell? A show this great, ruined by only 4-5 bad secondary actors.All in all, I would give 9 out of 10 to this amazing production. Would recommend to anyone.
3	30 September 2021	katiepham	Very hypocritical and not a REAL death-game show	I don't know why the show gets so much praise internationally. I mean overall it's a really bingeable show, but there's really nothing much aside from that. In my country, the show receives so many polarized comments, with people either loving it badly or hating it with passion.The game master said that the game is created so that those mistreated in the outside world will be treated equally in the game, and yet the master himself did not get shot when he lost the game (voluntarily or not). In the "walking on glass" game, when one candidate knew how to tell tempered glass from normal glass, the front man turned off all the lights just to make the game more entertaining to the VIPs, effectively rendering the poor man unable to use his skills. I guess it's still much advantageous to be rich and powerful even in the so-called equal game, hah?The main character is horrible. He's a loser with no character development throughout the movie. He's described as a person that has so much compassion and empathy with others, yet in the end he didn't even bother visiting his daughter in the US - all because of some nonsense triggering comments from the front man. And gosh he wouldn't even have kept his promise to the North Korean defecting girl to take care of her brother had it not been for the call from the organizer. Such a f*cked-up man who I have no sympathy for.There are so many other flaws in the movie that I don't have time to bother mentioning. All in all, a movie with good intentions and palatable cinematography, but horrendous execution. If you like death-game shows, better watch Alice in Borderland, Jinrou Game, the Incite Mill, Liar Game, or many that actually make you use your brain to figure out how to escape your ill-fated situation and don't annoy you with hypocritical mouthings.
7	1 October 2021	harold-03666	Fun to watch. Don't get why all the memes and media coverage.	The show is fun to watch and serves its purpose, entertain you.As for the plot there are several wholes and mistakes, and even things that do not get anywhere. But it's interesting and the character development is good.Now the worst part, the VIPs. Worst actors ever. Poorly executed and maybe poorly written? I can't imagine directing and seeing that performance and allowing it to make the cut.
10	15 October 2021	Yash97	This show is worth your time!!!	Squid game is an excellent show that piques your interest from the get-go. They slowly build up the story and once you understand what happens with the people who lose the game; you're hooked.If you have the eye of a detective (like me), then you'll know from the first game that the old man is involved in some way and is not just a player.The 4th game has a lot of twists and is a rollercoaster of emotions. This episode will make even the toughest people cry.I definitely recommend this show.
10	1 October 2021	danielkees-55784	Just overwhelming	I watched the series in german sync. I cannot understand the bad reviews about the VIPs. In the german sync version they speak english to underline the international connection to the "Squid game". Of course some of them are not native speakers and the fact, that they all wear masks makes it even harder to act, but keep in mind that this is a korean production and the budget was definitely litmited for these charakters.
9	27 September 2021	bensn	To everyone complaining about the VIP acting	In my opinion they played so ridiculously bad to portrait what they think about the Americans and to mock them with their bad jokes. Their cast was really good and i dont think they just didn't get the right actors to play the Americans.
6	16 October 2021	nikolayu	End could be better	Series is ok. But the end is very bad. They could made something different. It's looked like they lost idea how to finish the season. If they wanted to make some room for the season 2 the could be more creative.
10	24 September 2021	sarahmimoun	mindblowing	This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.
8	28 September 2021	sdsdmn	It's good but please no need to s2	So fas so good but please Netflix there is no need to season 2 you will ruined it.
9	2 October 2021	johnmessaris	AMAZING	IT IS VERY BIG AND IS FROM KOREA.... FANTASTIC.... ONE BIG BANG AT YOUR STOMACH...
9	21 September 2021	raphiou	Surprising	I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly.
8	8 October 2021	fanjuntian	AMAZING SOCIAL COMMENTARY! We, the viewers, are the real VIPs!	Criticize the VIPs all you want, but don't ding the show for the VIP's bad acting, poor scripts, and being terribly out of place altogether. I believe all of that is intentional. We, as viewers of the show, are just like the VIPs. We are paying for our Netflix subscriptions to fund the show's production, and watching this "game" fold out for our entertainment. It's no wonder these VIPs purposefully speak English.If you're disgusted by the VIPs (and hopefully most of us are), then you should be disgusted by ourselves and our roles in society.
2	17 October 2021	ivanilov	Good idea but scenario is disappointing	It is hard to explain my thought without spoilers but I have to do this, cause rating of Squid Game is so good. You won't see any drama in here. Main characters will do things just because the script writer wanted to do so but you won't understand motivation of them. Especially motivation of main hero. Director, operators, editors, costume guys and other people involved in Squid Game production did a pretty good job but script writer ruined everything. Watch this ably as pop-corn movie because there's no character design in it, no interesting twists, no drama - nothing.
1	1 October 2021	nenadkovac	very predictable	There is no need to spend time on such a predictable series.
7	5 October 2021	abdulazizshamrani	Perfect but ain't that much	I think the general idea and scenario were really good. The characters and actors had done great work but I think there was too much violence and blood in the episodes.Besides that, there were some unrealistic events during the episodes like for example:when the policeman went to the island hiding under the van. Like common how's that even possible?! Which part under the car he was holding to it ?!please tell me also how did the phone Battery hold for more than 5 days ?!And there are more and more of that unrealistic events.In general, it's was a great serious and it deserves watching but the blood, violence and the unrealistic events might ruin it a little bit.
1	5 October 2021	thatguysfan	No respect for time	Great start with no worthwhile return. Lat episodes waste time and give no value to end. Absolutely stupid show.
8	22 September 2021	saif-54226	Next season	A really good series its only need better writing, think carefully about the quotes, for the next season it will be epic if it was in Spain with Spanish actors.
6	23 September 2021	frankthompson-38112	Cant miss premise that was lost in translation	Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending.
8	21 September 2021	tedddik	Not again	Would give it 10 if it ended with an ending.Please don't ruin this with a second season.
4	6 October 2021	bwesdijk	Overhyped and boring.	I don't know why people hype this up so much. Story is boring and predictable.The VIPs were bad actors, and the other characters were mostly annoying.As said in my first sentence I can't seem to understand why people like this so much and that it is rated an 8.3..
9	28 September 2021	dianesim	Amazing	Very good. Worth watching, can't wait for season 2.
9	17 September 2021	sandriani-58818	Bingeable	Dub was good. Awesome show, give it a watch it was a lot of fun.
10	10 October 2021	spyross-13577	No review	There is no need for an actual review. Just watch this piece of art.
10	18 September 2021	jacobio-89463	One of the best movie of this kind	Plot, visuals, acts, scale... every elements were so well prepared and harmonized. The characters have distinct personalities and are very interesting.According to the characteristics of each stage of the survival game, the appearances of the characters collide and gather whenever they encounter in extreme situations. All those factors fit each other amazingly well. Each character also represents an aspect of society issue or shape of human beings.This movie is not only giving you entertainment, but also throw questions about matter of humanity, morals, strategy, social issues, family and the weight of life & death.There is no scene to skip.
7	18 September 2021	minisaulol	Loved it, but...	My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful.
6	5 October 2021	fertz_coronado	Very slow	Very slow, I expected it to catch me from chapter one and in the middle I stopped it to finish it another day. The idea is not bad but in general it is not what I expected.
9	17 October 2021	karaghuli	ok	Everything becomes boring after a point"The goal is not to make lot of money but after making lots n lots is not to get bore while enjoying the material thingsWhat a series man The bestest series everI so wanted Sae byeok to win the prize money.
10	9 October 2021	shinpagba	So good 10/10	Unbelievably good. A must watch. One of the best things to come out of Netflix.
0	6 October 2021	dominic_kh	Bad lip sync	I was talking to Cahir about it lastnight. Concept is decent and can see why it's popular but the dialog in the show is so stupid! It's like they're forcing lines to cover up the Korean lip sync.
9	26 September 2021	joshuadanielpeck	Insane!	I really wish at the end, the frontman was just Mr Beast. Seems like something he would do just to mix it up a bit.All seriousness aside, this is a real thrill ride with some absolutely brutal moments and really shows the lengths people go to stay alive. Greed, guilt, remorse, relief and anger are just a handful of the emotions shown by the cast.Very thought provoking and would highly recommend to anyone.
10	15 October 2021	kevinlevinski	The Dream of Horror Fans	This series reminded me of Alice in Borderland which some web pages suggest you to watch after finishing this series. I have never written a review about Alice in Borderland by i am writing about this since its was better than the Japanese series which was based on manga and anime (they didn't finish the anime though).Now back to this series. Personally i am skeptic to Korean shows since i watch only western Hollywood movies and series but i gotta say here the Koreans surpassed the Americans way better just as they did with Oldboy(2001) which was copied by Hollywood in Oldboy(2013) which stars Josh Brolin (the guy wtho plays Thanos) and with the movie Miracle in Cell Number 7 that the Turkish stole and made a Netflix movie of their own.I call it the dream of all horror fans since every horror fan likes movies like Nine Dead, The Unknown, Saw 2, The Killing Room, Fermats Room, Cube, FunHouse, The Platform and most importantly the movie Would You Rather (2012).Its the same like Would You Rather with characters who suffer from debts and have desperate ways of living along with the lack of the opportunities to breakthrough and pay their debts which if they do not they risk their internal organs. The beauty of the show is that the participants participate willingly in the deadly contests. No one forces them to do but they do it with their own free will. Its more elaborted than Would You Rather when we get to see the management, the ranks of the guards and the officials, how the system works etc....If you like these kinds of horror shows and you are addicted to them there is no better one than this.
10	4 October 2021	davidsonpi	Superb	It's rare I get into tv shows but gave this a try as a lot of people had recommended it. It's absolutely superb, gripping from start to finish.
6	14 October 2021	maakundo	Weak logic	I find the logic/reason behind the death games is very weak. Otherwise the thrills, exitment, acting desighn all are quete good. But for the ending and the logic i give the rating 6 in overall. If their a strong logic behind this games i wpuld give it to 9.
9	11 October 2021	loopyy-77258	Plot hole	Before 4th game there are 39 players. The madwoman can't find anyone to play with and they stay to play 38.They are divided into pairs and so there are 19 dead and 19 comeback and continue in game 5.Then those 19+ crazy woman witch is waiting for them, they had to be 20, not 17 as they showed is episode 7 at the beginning.3 players are lost !!!?
10	5 October 2021	abdulmannan-56604	One of the best shows on netflix. Period!	Finally Netflix has created a masterpiece. No doubt about that. If you are a lover of the purge series,and can withstand a bit of violence and blood,mixed with human emotions and hard truths,this series is tailor made for you. You wont be able to stop after watching the first episode,you can bet on that. Excellent thriller!
6	30 September 2021	hanlawrence	Korean cinema is still overall immature and overhyped	As a Korean-American who is a fan of cinema, Korean film and television still has a long way to go overall. There are a few standout directors (Bong Joon Ho and. Park Chan Wook immediately come to mind), but in general-as demonstrated in Squid Game-Korean cinema is prone to over-dramatization, reducing character to two dimensional caricatures, very obvious and amateur plot holes among other glaring faults that take away from the effect and value of the film. The plot is engaging to be sure, but the execution prevents me from feeling fully invested in the emotional turmoil of the characters.Decent series overall but not at all deserving of whatever hype it's received.
10	10 October 2021	fatihakgun	After weeks i still can't forget about this show !	I never reviewed a movei or show before on IMDB, but this show made me wanna do it, because its this show is just beautifull, the actors are sooo great at acting, the show is just a perfectiongo and watch it goddammit.
9	18 September 2021	jeremy_juan	Surprisingly Good Movie!	Was expecting a typical graphic Korean movie... Turned out the movie was engaging with a nice twist to the ending. Highly recommended!
1	21 September 2021	marcusdz	All that for a trope we've seen over and over again	The show's moral is "the poor and rich are similar". The poor being the good guys and the rich being the bad guys. As reasonable as the trope is, this one is executed terribly. Let's call is this a "Game of Thrones" ending: I was enthralled until the 7th episode and then it was garbage.
3	26 September 2021	shalrath	Derivative, obvious, dull.	We've seen every element of this before. My wife and I sat here predicting how every single scene would play out. The acting, while carried by a few good performances, was uninspiring and the lack of character development made it hard to care for the fates of anyone in the show. More enjoyment came from retranslating the poor subtitles than actually following the story.
10	5 October 2021	wimpieheath	Westworld	Yes, Westworld. Really. Westworld? Yes, that American show. Westworld. Yes, Westworld!? !!? It started like a Western? Yes. Then kinda got like The Matrix? Yes. Sort of. Ah, WESTWORLD!!!!!ButBetter.
8	7 October 2021	lemankatayanagi	Not too "fantasy"	The thing I love about this series is the game was designed or held by a normal people. That what makes the games has flaws, so when some of the contestants cheated, it makes sense for the pink guard didn't noticed since they're also normal people.
6	9 October 2021	taijahiltunen	Nice idea but..	Really nice idea, but I think it would've worked better as a movie. Maybe even a movie series? Even in 9 episodes I didn't get that bond with the characters, so I would've just leave some out. I think there was a lot of unnecessary scenes for such a short season. I didn't really see the policeman finding his brother very necessary for example. The old man was really a key for this one, he really saved the whole series at the end. All in all this movie still gets 6/10 because of the great casting, visuals, set and the idea.
8	14 October 2021	tharocker-35227	Great acting and story apart from the Skyrim npcs	The show has a lot going for it, most of is positive until the VIPs come in to play. Their acting and script are horrible. To me, they came across as Skyrim NPCs. Apart from this the series is super solid and one of the best to watch at the moment. Great work!
1	12 October 2021	marinosd	Overrated series	I don't have a lot to say about it.. Acting 1/10 and story 2/10. So overrated series. Not really good actors and slow movie. I was waiting to see if it was going to be some twist but the way they directed this series was so wrong.
10	4 October 2021	indocalido-10972	Wow	Great Korean actors, the main ones performance impeccable. Couldn't stop watching. Watched the nine hours series in one weekend. Yeah the VIP performance sucks but i guess they have stored it for the next seasons. Korean horror movies, train to busan, parasite, squid game rocks!
7	11 October 2021	jmjam-50730	Great show with a horrible ending	I'm going to keep this short but this show was going amazing right up until the vip episode where it began to crumble to pieces. The plot and the high school theater level acting of the vips made me want to turn off the episode. I still don't think that was worse than the last episode though the ending was way too predictable and I hated what they did with the old man. Overall a good show but they definitely could've wrapped it up better.
6	17 October 2021	radu-33154	An overrated series	The idea is somewhat interesting but has many unrealistic elements. Yes, it is a fiction, but even in a fiction people's reactions must be realistic. You can watch the show if you have nothing better to do.
9	2 October 2021	chioseauapetru	Growing	One of the best asian series. The subject is interesting but i cannot see a good continuity.
8	30 September 2021	lebohouse	Korean audio a must.	Do yourself a big favor and listen to the Korean audio with subtitles. The voice over dialog does t do the show any justice. Very enjoyable. Has a Parasite meet Maze Runner type of feel.
9	27 September 2021	chadwyngaard	Worth a binge!!!	Slow at times, but intense and engaging throughout. Acting was on point and I loved how they mixed different elements of society and human behavior.The only issue was the VIPs. Quite the buzz kill in terms of acting and overall performance. They didn't fit in there they way they should. Casting failGive it a watch peeps!
6	2 October 2021	rock_the_house-99685	Meh...interesting premise. Poor execution	Interesting premise. Characters are flawed however they are not people you would get behind. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy who just stole from his elderly mother to gamble? And feel bad for him when he is mugged?Also watching in English with subtitles. The dubbed voices are laughable. Netflix should've put an usher behind the voice actors for the English Dub.Not as gory as everyone is saying it is. And not many characters to get behind. It's well shot and the acting is good however the story and characters make it generic like things before it Saw, Escape room, Hostel etc.
10	6 October 2021	lgtlyf	Emotional rollercoaster	Firstly, I want to address the VIP criticism. I honestly hated the VIPs too, but considering how breathtakingly good the acting was by EVERYONE involved, I think their over the top, cringe inducing acting was purposeful. You're SUPPOSED to loathe them, and they are meant to be insufferable and cold.With that out of the way, without spoiling anything, I think that the intentionality behind every shot, every line, and the beautiful sets was unfathomably great. I felt every emotion along this ride of a show and have never "ugly cried" during any movie or show in my life like I did with Squid Game. In my opinion, this is the best show or movie I have ever seen and I've been recommending it to everyone. This is the first review I've ever submitted to IMDB; I went out of my way to write it because I was so moved by this series.I'm hoping for another season and am dying to learn more about so many things going on at the end. Luckily, the rewatchability of this show is of the highest degree due to the many Easter eggs and intentionally placed foreshadowing throughout. This show deserves every bit of recognition it's received and then some. If you're on the fence about watching this show, WATCH IT!
10	20 September 2021	andrewjking-70710	A diamond in the rough from Korea.	Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap.
3	3 October 2021	samoricos	Terrible acting and many plot holes	This series is highly overrated. The acting is amateur like, too much drama, drags for way too long, and the story has many plot holes that are difficult to overlook. I don't understand how this series got so popular... I understand that a lot may be lost in translation but really this is a cheap try to make something that keeps you hooked but has no substance at all.
4	5 October 2021	jmcnobre	What an overrated show	People are overestimating this series in a way never seen before, it's just an average series,basically this series takes several movies and series and mixes them all together, the only game that's really interesting to watch is the first one.
4	10 October 2021	ka-99152	Parasite meets Hunger Games meets Hostel meets The Cube	This series really does not add anything new for us who've seen it all. Yes, it's addictive, but a disappointing end of the season, and while I can imagine how the next and hopefully final season is going to look like, I'm not going to invest more time in it.I don't know about how the Korean script is like, but the American parts is below par.If you've watched the movies I've listed in the title, don't bother to watch this series.
1	17 October 2021	fengelaar	ridiculous	..and bad acting 😫 never have i seen a serie as bad as this one.. like i sad: ridiculous!I dont know why people are so exsided, its a really stupid story..
6	27 September 2021	xhresthaxunav	A good start with disappointing ending and a useless MC.	The show started good gor the couole of episodes but began to downgrade at the endings. The VIPs were awfully bad and full of cringe dialogue of 9 year olds. As for the main lead actor of the show, he was not good in any aspect. The Pakistani guy was more likable than him. Except for one episode I don't think there is any scene in which the main lead actor is useful.
10	23 September 2021	kyeo-59420	Great show!!	Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!
1	11 October 2021	fancy-7	the worst series I have ever watched	The worst series I have ever watched. Very naive action and desperate acting.
8	3 October 2021	stephenmacky	A hell of a rollercoaster ride	Since I've recently finished the current season of the show, i thought I'd share my views here. I'd like to start off by saying that the show started off on a good note. I started watching it like pretty much everyone else, it created a lot of buzz on the Internet, so I thought it must be worth checking out. The concept of the show was itself good and for the most part, well executed. It took me back, since when I first started watching the show, I didn't know what to expect. I felt like the show did generally well with the character development and the plot, despite the little time it had. My primary criticism is aimed towards the aftermath from episode 6 of the show. The show was really a hell of a rollercoaster ride till that point. Like many others, I also disliked the portrayal of the VIPs. Their portrayal was more of an annoyance and a disturbance than anything else. They had weird accents and pronunciation, cheesy lines and way of talking. They served more to distract than add something to the plot. The final boss fight between Gi-hun and Sang-woo could also have been performed better. Sang-woo went down too easily. The detective's (presuming he survived) and his brother's storylines were left on a cliffhanger. Then the ending is the current and trending problem of the show. It left too many unanswered questions and it'd be disappointing for the show to end on such a note. If there are plans for a 2nd season, then it will have a lot of explaining to do: the organization, how Gi-hun was able to stay under the radar despite being filthy rich, the role of In-ho and etc.
9	26 September 2021	amadteek	Amazing	It's simply one of the best thriller series I've ever seen. I'm starting to dig in the Korean TV series to find sth similar.
6	17 October 2021	nikolajevtic-23115	Really good up to episode 7...	I personally don't like this type of shows, where people get locked in something , and they all die except one person. But, i liked it here because this time, it was different. It showed exactly why those people are in there, and i really like the choice they gave them, so everybody was in there because of their own will. They really did awesome description of every single main character, and why they choose to play the game. That is what kept me into the series, and why it is different from all the other shows like that.BUT, after episode 6, everything went downside in my opinion... Ending is just horrible, it has no meaning to why they did all of this ( i mean, that plot twist at the end was nothing special ), but fun... Common really.. . I feel like it is not that well described, it was fast explained , and put into half of episode, done really fast... That is just my opinion, otherwise great show , coming from person who does not like this types of show at all !
8	9 October 2021	mikesmanus	Amazingly Entertaining	I just wish that they could find voice actors doing the English Audio that don't sound so dorky and that have some sort of acting training. The show was great and the idea was spectacular but the voice actors really made it hard to wanna keep watching. It's like they were trying to sound cheesy and Netflix was totally okay with that.
10	5 October 2021	wwwbirddownload	Amazing	Just watch itI watch a million TV shows & moviesAnd I shoud say this is one of my best experiences.
9	28 September 2021	joshowl	One of the best recent Netflix shows (switch the Korean audio)	The voice actors are incredibly cringe in this show, it wasn't until episode 4 where I discovered I could change the audio to Korean within the Netflix settings. Makes it so much better.
10	6 October 2021	armanzk	One of the Best Shows I've Ever Seen	I've personally found the majority of Netflix's original content to be mediocre or uninteresting. Stranger Things was the last series that left a big impression on me (at least the first season lol). Now Squid Game's done it.A+ storytelling, character development, cinematography, set design, costume design, acting, writing, editing. It was so well done. I was pulled in from the start and invested in it as though it was all real. It's top tier entertainment, and it should be no surprise to anyone because of how well it's doing in both the US and the rest of the world. If it were as bad as other reviews might say, it wouldn't be getting so much social media buzz and definitely wouldn't be closing in as the most streamed Netflix series of all time. It's just that good. Not to discredit more critical reviews, but they're subjective. Nothings ever for everyone. But Squid Game has proven to be for most with its huge popularity.The credit for this show is the director/writer. He's a genius and had a lot of weight on him with making this, and I'm so glad Netflix picked his idea up after a decade of not finding anyone to help make this show. I watched this with my friend, and I'll be watching again with my family if they decide to see it too.I watched the Korean audio with English subtitles, and from what I've been seeing online, that's been the best way to watch it. It started playing automatically in English dub, and my friend and I were like "ehhh no" when we heard it. So glad we changed it.I can't wait to see a second season.
9	4 October 2021	akfalakz	Critical series! But the acting of the VIPs sucks	One of the best making and a simple storyline but the message of human kind behaviour makes the story more interesting.
9	4 October 2021	lolik-20978	Phenomenal!	The plot is great, the acting is superb & the soundtrack is very neatly placed! Squid Game manages to shock, excite & pull your heart strings right from the get go. A must watch if you're up for some good time & aren't easily disturbed by some gore.
1	14 October 2021	991elizabeth	Worst serie ever!	All the hype on social media made me sit and watch the serie - and yes, I expected something really gooood!I saw some comments online about the "message" of the serie and how good and educational it is and how this serie make us understand our mistakes and blah blah and I was expecting to see that - but let's be honest, the serie is b u l l s h i t!(Don't let me start on the bad acting :S).----From episode 1 to episode 10: The main character is some weak ass idiot that after all he went through he couldnt just get his shit together and get his daughther back! End of the movie :)I hope you dont waste 10 hours of tour life just like I did and I am so sorry about it!
1	3 October 2021	themichaud-49875	It's trash. I want 8 hours of my life back	All the thumbs down. It's an inane, trite, heavy-handed slog that repeatedly insults the viewer's intelligence by having a character awkwardly explain scenes that just happened to nobody in particular.
1	10 October 2021	ayushbindal-54247	Rubbish, Senseless, worst ever content on internet	Most rubbish thing i have ever watched in my life till date. Censorship on OTT platform is required to weed out such content.
2	25 September 2021	gabrielorlandorc	Wasted Potential	Predictable and melodramatic to a fault. The treatment of the female characters was botched, the whole production felt unbelievably forced... And don't even get me started on the VIPs.
2	3 October 2021	simonwjpegg	Why?	The challenge is to get the end without the need to shoot yourself in the head! Acting pretty cringeworthy and drawn out far too long! Nice cinema photography though!
6	9 October 2021	sumansaharock	Predictable plot, not worth that much hype	Plot is predictable. Nothing new to offer. Better movies are there in this genre.
10	7 October 2021	rastyditya	Best KDRAMA in the world 🌍 can't wait for SEASON 2	Best evee but in SEASON 2 I HOPE SUNBYOUK CAN BE BACK WHAT EVER HAPPEN I DON'T CARE BECAUSE SHE WON ALL FANS HEART AND ALI NO.199 TOO.
9	11 October 2021	alisonhmgordon	Ending strongly suggesting a serious 2 yay	Nutshell gripping, easy to binge watch, Not suitable for kids. Very dark and enjoyable A tad predictable. But the games were fantastic to watch. Agree with many on here the last 2 episodes were a bit rushed . Overall brilliant 👏
10	20 September 2021	xponothing	Absolute Masterpiece	Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit????? But overall excellent great work Netflix.
10	5 October 2021	shirinshoqli	Masterpiece!	I really enjoyed it and suggest this series to everyone I know! Perfect.
8	5 October 2021	hbbatis	Watch it!	The story is great and has so much potential, but I just don't understand why they would give big clues about the ending plot in the middle of the season, although they still managed to put plots in each episode. The ending could be better but it's 100% worth watching and I'm already waiting for the second season lol.
7	29 September 2021	tkremn	Great storyline BUT bad acting	The story, the motif is great, but the conversation, the acting between characters are so lame.It could be a cultural things that Koreans speak that way.Just my opinion. Take it or leave it.
10	3 October 2021	step-29916	Masterpiece	One of the best series ive ever watched,i hope it gets renewed for second season.
9	24 September 2021	rjgodfrey	Absolutely brilliant.	I'm not really into films with dubbing but this was done well so you don't even notice. Probably up there with my favourite every series.
4	10 October 2021	anilmurmu-86686	Boring	It's not a mind blowing series just a ok type series.the issue of this series is it's a boring series.starting was very slow and all those games are not interesting to watch.
1	15 October 2021	sharonconnaughton	Disappointing and Uneventful	With all the hype about this series, I thought this would be a fantastic series to watch.How disappointing it was, I stuck with it just waiting for something exciting to happen and to finally see why it was no. 1 on Netflix but that excitement never came. I was not sat on the edge of my seat nor did I long for the next episode to start.In fact, I must agree with the 10 producers and directors that refused to take this series on.And that woman's voice! It just shrieks through your head and rips your ears out until you have no eardrum left!!! The best part of this series was th titles at the end of the whole series. Thank god it finished, but I really regret starting it and being told it was something it's really not.My advice, give it a miss, You will just waste hours of your life for no good reason at all!
10	27 September 2021	ferasbob	There is not a second of boredom in tv show	I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.
10	18 September 2021	zinebkarami	Recommended	I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.
10	4 October 2021	mistressbrianna	Absolutely beautiful series	This series is beautifully produced and directed. So many stories with in itself and has drama, action, suspence. I couldn't stop watching it. I hope they do a second season, or add more episodes.Beware parents not for children, lots of death, gore, blood, simulated dead bodies, violence.
